      "content": "Fusion energy is often mocked as a technology perpetually 30 years away, but recent breakthroughs in basic fusion science suggest otherwise. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) continues to set new records for fusion energy yield in a laboratory setting, improving upon 2022\u2019s scientific net energy gain milestone (LLNL 2022, 23). In addition to NIF\u2019s laser experiments, superconducting magnet advances at MIT and subsequent private sector growth mean commercial fusion is closer than ever before (Chandler 2024, ITER 2023). [...] The best-funded approach to harness fusion energy is magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), which works by magnetically compressing a plasma within a reactor for a relatively long period of time. The most common MCF reactor design is the donut-shaped tokamak, but other designs like the stellarator and the field-reversed configuration also exist (ITER 2024; U.S. Department of Energy 2019, 24).\n\nThe recent breakthroughs in high-temperature superconducting magnets have increased the viability of MCF, with the FIA listing 25 startups in the space (Chandler 2024). Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), an MIT spinoff that has received nearly $3 billion in funding, aims to deliver power to the grid in the early 2030s (CFS 2025). [...] The bipartisan Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy (ADVANCE) Act, passed on July 9, 2024, includes the Fusion Energy Act, which allows fusion to sidestep the harsh limitations placed on fission technologies (FIA 2024; U.S. Congress, Senate 2024; Zhang 2024). It codifies the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s earlier decision to place fusion energy systems under the same regulatory framework as particle accelerators, streamlining the path to grid deployment. Without this, fusion could be subject to the costly, time-intensive approval processes that were developed in the wake of fission energy incidents (NRC 2022).",

Due to the reduced demands on confinement time and compression velocities, MTF has been pursued as a lower-cost and simpler approach to investigating these challenges than conventional fusion projects.

[...] Efficient heat removal for electricity generation: While fusion produces intense energy, the physical structure of tokamak fusion reactors is that of a geometric heat source, poorly configured to efficiently remove the heat produced from the fusion reaction. Traditional heat removal designs used in fossil fuel or nuclear fission plants interface directly with the heat generation process, whereas in a fusion reactor any such interface would disrupt the plasma and stop the fusion reaction. ITER's design will demonstrate heat removal, but more R&D is needed to raise the efficiency for practical electricity generation.\n\nA fusion reaction is about four million times more energetic than a chemical reaction such as the burning of coal, oil or gas.\n\n## Explore Further: Fusion [...] In ITER, fusion will be achieved in a tokamak device that uses magnetic fields to contain and control the hot plasma.

Few materials can survive these harsh conditions, so inadequate plasma-facing components could require replacement every few years.\n\nMoreover, some presently-used materials contaminate the plasma, reducing efficiency, and others absorb precious unreacted tritium. Each of these risks imperils power plant economics. Given the historically long timelines for materials development, advanced materials should be pursued as a top priority today (King 2018).

      "content": "### Conclusion\n\nOverall, the Trump EO reflects a fundamental shift in US AI policy, prioritizing deregulation and freemarket innovation while reducing oversight and ethical safeguards. However, this approach could create challenges for US companies operating in jurisdictions with stricter AI regulations, such as the EU, the UK, Canada and Japan \u2013 as well as some of those states in the US that have already enacted their own AI regulatory regimes. The divergence between the US federal government\u2019s pro-innovation strategy and the precautionary regulatory model pursued by the EU and these US states underscores the need for companies operating across these jurisdictions to adopt flexible compliance strategies that account for varying regulatory standards. [...] Another significant shift in policy is the approach to regulation. The Trump EO mandates an immediate review and potential rescission of all policies, directives and regulations established under the Biden EO that could be seen as impediments to AI innovation. The Biden EO, however, introduced a structured oversight framework, including mandatory red-teaming for high-risk AI models, enhanced cybersecurity protocols and monitoring requirements for AI used in critical infrastructure. The Biden administration also directed federal agencies to collaborate in the development of best practices for AI safety and reliability efforts that the Trump EO effectively halts. [...] The Trump administration\u2019s deregulatory approach comes at a time when other jurisdictions, particularly the EU, are moving toward stricter regulatory frameworks for AI. The EU\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act), which was adopted by the EU Parliament in March 2024, imposes comprehensive rules on the development and use of AI technologies, with a strong emphasis on safety, transparency, accountability and ethics. By categorizing AI systems based on risk levels, the EU AI Act imposes stringent requirements for high-risk AI systems, including mandatory third-party impact assessments, transparency standards and oversight mechanisms.",

This proposal indicates that only the AI systems with computing and reasoning capacities reaching (to be) prescribed thresholds or applied in (to be) prescribed industries and sectors need to be assessed and approved by the Chinese authorities before being put into the market. This is different from the current regulatory approach, which requires all AI systems to be assessed and approved and thus (strictly speaking) makes all overseas-hosted AI systems illegal and subject to the risk of being blocked in China.\n\nTechnological measures to address risks",

The underlying rationale is that AI technology still needs space to grow and develop before sweeping, binding regulations are put in place. Both government and private organizations have published various AI ethical principles and guidelines, and there are bills proposed at both federal and state levels. However, nothing as broad or centralized as the EU AI Act is currently on the horizon. This lightweight, sectoral approach is similar to the U.S. stance on data privacy regulation. [...] ### Determination to Maintain State Control\n\nA defining feature of China\u2019s AI regulation is the emphasis on maintaining state control, which can sometimes clash with the goal of fostering rapid AI adoption. This need for control was recently reaffirmed by Xi Jinping, underscoring the importance of ensuring AI development aligns with the \u201ccorrect political direction.\u201d While certain regulatory requirements have been softened to support AI growth, these political obligations remain firmly in place, particularly for public-facing AI systems.

This policy digest explores recent breakthroughs, the need for political support, and challenges in bringing fusion to market.\n\n[Download PDF](https://kleinmanenergy.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/KC-Digest-81-Bringing-Fusion-Energy-to-the-Grid.pdf)\n\n## At A Glance\n\n### Key Challenge\n\nDespite increased private investment, fusion energy faces engineering problems, supply chain uncertainty, and a relatively small academic research ecosystem that could limit its economic viability.\n\n### Policy Insight\n\nThe recent Fusion Energy Act marked a major step forward in regulatory certainty for fusion. But fusion needs bolstering of academic research and critical supply chains.\n\n13,000 tons\n\nA single kilogram of fusion fuel releases the same amount of energy as 13,000 tons of coal.\n\n## Introduction: The Case for Fusion\n\nDespite progress in deploying renewables like solar and wind, about 65% of U.S. electricity still comes from fossil fuels (U.S. Energy Information Administration 2024). Fusion, the carbon-neutral process that powers the sun, offers a transformative alternative if technological and economic barriers are overcome (IAEA 2023). Standard deuterium-tritium fusion fuel can release millions of times more usable energy than an equivalent mass of fossil fuels\u2014roughly 3\u00d71014 J/kg as compared to 3\u00d7107\u2014and it even surpasses the energy density of uranium fission (World Nuclear Association 2024).\n\nWhile power plant components will require medium-term radioactive waste management, the self-limiting nature of fusion plasmas makes fission-style meltdowns impossible (EIA 2024; IAEA 2023). If technologically realized, fusion could provide baseload electricity without operational carbon emissions, support rising energy demands from artificial intelligence, and promote domestic energy security.\n\nFusion energy is often mocked as a technology perpetually 30 years away, but recent breakthroughs in basic fusion science suggest otherwise. The National Ignition Facility (NIF) continues to set new records for fusion energy yield in a laboratory setting, improving upon 2022\u2019s scientific net energy gain milestone (LLNL 2022, 23). In addition to NIF\u2019s laser experiments, superconducting magnet advances at MIT and subsequent private sector growth mean commercial fusion is closer than ever before (Chandler 2024, ITER 2023).\n\nThe private sector has taken notice of this progress, with hyperscalers like Google and Microsoft signing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with fusion startups. However, several major challenges to commercializing fusion will require public\u2013private cooperation and investment. For fusion to succeed on a climate-relevant timeline, policymakers should support fusion research and development as a national priority.\n\n## Fusion as a Baseload to Intermittent Renewables\n\nExisting renewables, like solar, wind, and hydroelectric, are excellent answers to some of our energy challenges. However, these technologies have fundamental limitations preventing them from providing a complete solution. The hourly and seasonal variability of the sun, wind, and water means renewables might not produce energy when needed, or they may stress the electricity grid during peak production.\n\nThe availability of land also limits renewables (Lovering et al. 2022). Solar farms must either invest in pricey land near population centers or pay for grid infrastructure upgrades. Likewise, offshore wind faces financing challenges; and half of economically viable hydropower has already been tapped (NPR 2023; IEA 2021).\n\nIf technically realized in the coming years, fusion energy systems would share few of the issues of current alternative energy sources. Fusion can provide reliable baseload power with a relatively small geographic footprint, unlike intermittent wind, solar, and hydroelectric power. It\u2019s often confused with nuclear fission power plants, but fusion doesn\u2019t produce long-lived radioactive waste, and it presents no risk of a meltdown from exponential chain reactions (IAEA 2024).\n\nMost importantly, deuterium and tritium\u2014the hydrogen isotopes most often proposed as feedstock for future fusion reactors\u2014could be extracted from seawater and regenerated during the fusion fuel cycle, respectively. Tritium regeneration remains a critical technical challenge for economical fusion. With continued fuel cycle R&D, these hydrogen isotopes may meet humanity\u2019s energy demand for millions of years (ITER 2024).\n\n## Fusion\u2019s Rapid Growth\n\n1. **New private funding is flowing into the fusion space**\n\nAfter decades of fusion investment being limited to universities and national labs, private companies are finally raising significant capital to build first-of-a-kind (FOAK) power plants (Dean 2004). According to the Fusion Industry Association (FIA), 53 private fusion startups have attracted $9.7 billion in total investment (private plus public) to date. In an optimistic scenario, their success could realize a $40 trillion market for fusion energy (FIA 2025; Bloomberg 2021).\n\nThese companies vary in their approaches and technological maturity, but the diverse set of approaches to fusion increases the likelihood that one will prove successful. Notably, more than two-thirds of fusion startups were founded within the past decade. However, companies estimate over $77B more is required to reach commercialization. This influx of private funding activity enables rapid technological progress, but it also intensifies an urgent need for new regulatory support.\n\n1. **Fusion funding supports multiple technological approaches, increasing the probability of success**\n\nThe best-funded approach to harness fusion energy is magnetic confinement fusion (MCF), which works by magnetically compressing a plasma within a reactor for a relatively long period of time. The most common MCF reactor design is the donut-shaped tokamak, but other designs like the stellarator and the field-reversed configuration also exist (ITER 2024; U.S. Department of Energy 2019, 24).\n\nThe recent breakthroughs in high-temperature superconducting magnets have increased the viability of MCF, with the FIA listing 25 startups in the space (Chandler 2024). Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), an MIT spinoff that has received nearly $3 billion in funding, aims to deliver power to the grid in the early 2030s (CFS 2025).\n\nHowever, MCF still faces major technological challenges. Few materials can withstand the constant bombardment of neutrons that would be found in a tokamak operating at full capacity. Additionally, the same principle that makes fusion safe makes it challenging: sustaining the fragile fusion plasma to produce steady-state power can be difficult.\n\nA second approach, inertial confinement fusion (ICF), has been responsible for recent scientific breakthroughs, from decades of research at the University of Rochester\u2019s Laboratory for Laser Energetics (UR-LLE) to the recent groundbreaking advances on the NIF experiment (LLNL 2022, LLE 2010). ICF involves compressing small, cryogenically cooled fuel pellets over a much shorter duration than MCF using powerful laser beams or other energy sources.\n\nThis short confinement time creates new issues. To produce net electricity, an ICF power plant would need to ignite pellets many times per second, which is a dizzying engineering challenge (Anderson 2024). Despite these hurdles, the FIA lists 11 startups, including Pacific Fusion and Focused Energy, that are pursuing inertial approaches.\n\n1. **Congress has successfully implemented a new regulatory framework for fusion under the ADVANCE Act.**\n\nThe bipartisan Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy (ADVANCE) Act, passed on July 9, 2024, includes the Fusion Energy Act, which allows fusion to sidestep the harsh limitations placed on fission technologies (FIA 2024; U.S. Congress, Senate 2024; Zhang 2024). It codifies the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s earlier decision to place fusion energy systems under the same regulatory framework as particle accelerators, streamlining the path to grid deployment. Without this, fusion could be subject to the costly, time-intensive approval processes that were developed in the wake of fission energy incidents (NRC 2022).\n\nNeutrons from fusion reactions can activate reactor components, which must be responsibly stored after decommissioning (Gonzalez de Vicente et al. 2022). Nevertheless, the Fusion Energy Act recognizes that fusion can produce nuclear energy without long-lived nuclear waste or the threat of meltdown, reducing regulatory uncertainty and paving the way for future investment.\n\n## Fusion\u2019s Greatest Challenges\n\nDespite the recent influx of capital to the fusion ecosystem and fusion\u2019s bipartisan government support, sustained effort will be required to bring the technology to market. Increased investment in the fusion workforce and research infrastructure, progress towards a competitive levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and widespread public education on fusion must occur before fusion power plants can be developed at scale.\n\n1. **Public funding for R&D facilities and workforce development**\n\nPrivate startups are driving fusion towards the grid, but profitability pressures limit their focus to near-term challenges. Developing a mature fusion industry in the U.S. will require fusion R&D facilities to pursue long-term questions that private companies cannot. It will also need an expansive fusion workforce to design, construct, and operate many new power plants. However, the imbalance between private and public investment\u2014public funding represents\u00a0 currently undermines that goal.\n\nScientific user facilities can enable academia and industry alike to collect experimental data without building their own reactor-scale labs, but only if they represent real fusion power plant conditions. Fusion-relevant heat fluxes, neutron energies, and durations require building a fusion device first, which is infeasible for most individual institutions.\n\nHistorically, facilities like the [UR-LLE National Laser Users\u2019 Facility](https://www.lle.rochester.edu/about-the-laboratory-for-laser-energetics/nluf/) (NLUF) program, the [DIII-D National Fusion Facility](https://science.osti.gov/fes/Facilities/User-Facilities/DIII-D), and Princeton\u2019s [National Spherical Torus Experiment](https://science.osti.gov/fes/Facilities/User-Facilities/NSTX-U) have enabled hundreds of users to conduct experiments not possible at their home institutions, diffusing knowledge while harnessing national scientific ingenuity (U.S. Department of Energy 2024). As private companies construct their own prototype fusion devices, private-public partnerships could secure their use for open-access science.\n\nDomestic R&D capabilities also hinge upon the availability of talented scientists and engineers to support each step of fusion commercialization. While many universities have plasma and fusion programs, few are large enough to provide a comprehensive fusion education. For each school with a listed fusion program, the median number of fusion faculty is 2, while the corresponding metric for nuclear fission programs is 16.5 (Whyte et al. 2023).\n\nParadoxically, increased funding for fusion may be weakening nuclear departments nationwide by attracting top graduate students and researchers toward industry instead of academia. To support the growing fusion ecosystem, the number of faculty at nuclear engineering programs and the resources of each program must be increased, which will benefit both research and instruction.\n\nExpanding faculty positions would have cascading benefits on course offerings, graduate student mentorship, opportunities for undergraduates, and research progress itself. More faculty would help develop a strong fusion research ecosystem at a greater number of universities and national labs, where future talent can be developed through hands-on experience (Whyte et al. 2023).\n\nTraining a workforce for a new industry cannot happen overnight. To meet the needs of the growing fusion industry, these opportunities for students should be expanded as soon and as broadly as possible.\n\nPrivate funding alone will not build R&D infrastructure at universities and national laboratories, and it will not prop up the academic ecosystem required to develop a fusion workforce. The current fusion investment landscape stimulates startup activity without strengthening the academic foundation needed to sustain industry.\n\nInstead, pairing private investments with increased public funding is of critical importance. This public investment, in turn, would clear future roadblocks for the private fusion industry, accelerating the timeline for deployment. Public-private fusion partnerships have accelerated globally, with the UK government recently announcing \u00a32.5 billion to be invested in fusion over the next five years (U.K. Atomic Energy Authority 2025). Now, Congress should ensure the nascent fusion industry thrives in America by allocating public funds to research infrastructure and fusion-relevant training.\n\n1. **Engineering a cost-competitive fusion power plant**\n\nConnecting a first-of-a-kind fusion reactor to the grid is only one step toward commercialization. Once a technological proof-of-concept is successful, successive reactors must become cost-competitive with today\u2019s most economical energy technologies: combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGT) and utility-scale solar farms (Schwartz et al. 2023).\n\nDespite the abundance and extreme energy density of fusion fuel, fusion plants will face high upfront capital costs, making low-cost power difficult in the industry\u2019s infancy. The LCOE of utility-scale solar PV farms ranges from $0.03 to $0.09 per kWh), and that of natural gas power plants is only slightly higher (Lazard 2024). Initial attempts at fusion plants may exceed $0.15 per kWh, which will only significantly decrease once several technical pain points are addressed (Lindley et al. 2023).\n\nOne of fusion\u2019s largest technological and economic challenges is designing materials compatible with fusion plasma environments, which are unlike anywhere else on Earth (Knaster et al. 2016). Few materials can survive these harsh conditions, so inadequate plasma-facing components could require replacement every few years.\n\nMoreover, some presently-used materials contaminate the plasma, reducing efficiency, and others absorb precious unreacted tritium. Each of these risks imperils power plant economics. Given the historically long timelines for materials development, advanced materials should be pursued as a top priority today (King 2018).\n\nEven more critically, the fusion fuel cycle, which will ensure recovery and regeneration of tritium, has yet to be fully engineered. Tritium, one of two fusion fuel inputs, is more reactive than alternative fuels, but its 12.3-year half-life means it does not exist in significant quantities naturally (Nuclear Engineering International 2025).\n\nInstead, it is produced by 30 CANDU-style fission reactors globally, which in total generate less than four kilograms of tritium per year (Canadian Nuclear Association 2025). Until the fuel cycle is closed in an operational power plant, tritium availability could throttle fusion development.\n\nThe U.S. could mitigate this risk by strengthening domestic tritium production, like the Watts Bar reactors in Tennessee, and allocating the tritium for fusion energy development (Federation of American Scientists 2024). This would ensure prototype reactors in the U.S. will not be stalled by fuel availability.\n\nFusion economics will also be limited by the ability of new supply chains to sustain private-sector growth. The fusion industry will require specialized components that don\u2019t yet have well-established supply chains, like superconducting cables and the aforementioned advanced materials (FIA 2023), and shortages of these components would delay development and inflate costs.\n\nAs companies strive to meet investor expectations and utility demand, suppliers will need to scale up rapidly to support them. For suppliers, this is a risky bet on the emerging fusion market. More likely, they will wait for fusion demonstration plants to succeed before expanding their operations.\n\nAfter successful power demonstrations, however, the diversity of fusion reactor designs could create standardization issues. As evidenced by France\u2019s successful nuclear fission development, standardizing reactor designs can drive down the costs of components and the resulting electricity (World Nuclear Association 2025). As specific designs emerge as leaders in the commercial fusion race, government regulation can support the industry\n\nOf course, the value that fusion provides extends far beyond a price at the meter. Unlike renewables, fusion will provide reliable baseload power that reduces the costs associated with managing intermittency. By eliminating the need for high volumes of imported fuel, fusion supports domestic energy security, and it also offers a less carbon-intensive alternative to today\u2019s baseload technologies.\n\nNevertheless, the price of building early fusion plants could diminish their impact on the energy landscape, so these costs must be minimized to accelerate large-scale deployment. Aggressively supporting advanced materials, establishing domestic tritium sources, and standardizing supply chains would be strong federal policy interventions.\n\n1. **Addressing disinformation and fostering public acceptance**\n\nFusion energy does not face the same catastrophic safety risks as fission, and it is crucial that the public recognize this. High-profile nuclear fission accidents and nuclear weapons shape public perceptions. Policymakers and the public often conflate these risks with fusion, creating a false equivalence. Decades of fission regulation show that public acceptance is essential for deploying new energy technologies.\n\nEven though fusion will not produce high-level radioactive waste\u2014in fact, irradiated components could eventually be recycled\u2014 fusion will face scrutiny due to the high-profile fission accidents of recent memory (ITER 2024). This scrutiny must be addressed by scientists, journalists, and policymakers to combat disinformation and increase public understanding.\n\nDisinformation about fusion is widespread. If left unaddressed, it could undermine public funding (van Lierop 2021). Commonly-held misconceptions include the beliefs that fusion reactors can \u201cmelt down\u201d like fission reactors, that fusion produces high-level radioactive waste, and that fusion systems will lead to nuclear proliferation (Gupta et al. 2024). Scientific and political communications should correct these beliefs clearly but graciously to avoid alienating members of the public.\n\nFrom fusion companies themselves, overly optimistic corporate press releases risk misleading stakeholders. In the race to secure venture funding and government grants, fusion startups may make aspirational claims about their progress and timelines for deployment (Gupta et al. 2024).\n\nThese claims may excite in the short term. However, when startups miss their targets, they erode trust in all fusion institutions and reinforce the old \u201cdecades away\u201d critique (Mumgaard 2024). Fusion companies and investors must take responsibility for maintaining trust in the science or risk losing long-term support.\n\nFor populations that have not been exposed to disinformation, the difference between fission and fusion can be explained to promote a robust understanding. This group includes not only students but also policymakers, other stakeholders, and the general public who are new to the topic and can support the rise of fusion technology.\n\nTherefore, fusion communication strategies should be appropriate for broad audiences. Explaining the physical distinction between fusion and fission to all stakeholders will be challenging, especially since nuclear physics education is rare at all levels, but it is one of the key challenges in bringing fusion to the grid.\n\n## Recommendations: A Fusion-Powered Future for Humanity\n\nIn recent years, investors and policymakers have demonstrated increased optimism about fusion energy. The G7 Climate, Energy and Environment Minister\u2019s Communiqu\u00e9 recently established a \u201cworking group to support multinational cooperation\u2026to realize fusion as an energy source\u201d (University of Pennsylvania 2024). However, government pledges to support fusion commercialization, like the 2022 White House fusion summit and COP28\u2019s Fusion Energy Task Force, conspicuously lack aggressive R&D budgets (White House 2022; IAEA 2023). Critics may argue that fusion is a risky, long-term investment that isn\u2019t ready for major public investment, but its R&D demands are exactly why fusion funding is important. Fusion progress stalled for decades under unstable public funding, and support remains limited today. The millions allocated to fusion pale in comparison to subsidies for other renewables, like multibillion-dollar solar tax credits (Reuters 2023), that were provided before the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. To accelerate progress today, policymakers should focus their efforts on fusion\u2019s key challenges.\n\n### *Support R&D Facilities and Workforce Development*\n\nUniversities and other public institutions require increased funding to advance foundational fusion research while educating and training a new workforce. Funds for these purposes are already available via the CHIPS and Science Act, which authorizes support for non-semiconductor technologies including advanced energy technologies (White House 2022).\n\nFor example, $10 billion is authorized for \u201cregional innovation and technology hubs\u201d\u2014exactly what is needed for fusion\u2014and much of this funding is still available. Congress can support the first key fusion challenge by appropriating available CHIPS and Science funds, ensuring that the U.S. remains a leader in the race to bring fusion energy to the grid.\n\nIn addition to these new funds, the Department of Energy should continue to support the catalytic Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program, which committed $46 million of federal funding to fusion companies. Sustaining these federal initiatives will help the fusion industry pursue R&D with longer time horizons, like fuel cycle engineering and advanced materials, that private companies may struggle to address otherwise\n\n### **Improve Fusion Economics**\n\nCapital costs for future fusion power plants must decrease, the fuel cycle must be closed, and standard fusion supply chains must be established. Policymakers can support these goals by securing access to critical materials for fusion, like tritium and rare earth elements for superconducting magnets (White House 2022).\n\nThe ADVANCE Act includes a requirement for a study on nuclear energy supply chains, but it does not explicitly mention fusion (U.S. Congress, Senate 2024). Expanding this requirement to add a parallel study for fusion supply chains would be an appropriate first step in improving economic viability and preventing catastrophic supply chain disruptions.\n\n### *Address Disinformation*\n\nStakeholders involved in fusion energy, which include the energy-consuming public in addition to governments, research institutions, and corporations, must be educated on the distinction between fusion and fission. Policymakers can help fund and publicize these efforts, which can happen at all levels of education and even beyond the classroom. The federal government is also responsible for involving communities in fusion development via Community Benefit Plans, and continuing this involvement will help spread awareness about fusion technology (Nehl 2023).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs the clean energy transition matures, it\u2019s important to direct government funding toward fusion, which isn\u2019t yet commercially viable but has the potential to transform global energy markets. Solar and wind power have become cost competitive as they\u2019ve matured, so public funds would be better spent on socially beneficial research that can\u2019t yet support itself (United Nations 2024).\n\nCutting-edge energy solutions like fusion must be prioritized in the U.S. energy strategy. By supporting the upstream fusion research ecosystem today with precisely targeted interventions, policymakers across the world will accelerate the arrival of a net-zero, energy-secure future.\n\n### Colby A.

Fusion Energy in 2025: Six Global Trends to Watch \n\nShare\n\n[](https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=1851715149085739&display=page&href=http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/fusion-energy-in-2025-six-global-trends-to-watch)[](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/fusion-energy-in-2025-six-global-trends-to-watch&text=Fusion%20Energy%20in%202025:%20Six%20Global%20Trends%20to%20Watch)[](mailto:?subject=Fusion%20Energy%20in%202025:%20Six%20Global%20Trends%20to%20Watch&body=http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/fusion-energy-in-2025-six-global-trends-to-watch)\n\nFusion Energy in 2025: Six Global Trends to Watch\n=================================================\n\n28 October 2025\n\n**Emma Midgley**, IAEA Office of Public Information and Communication \n\n![Image 2](http://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/styles/landscape_medium/public/2025-10/vsm8csm2inasshallsmall.jpg.webp?itok=DMWXttc2)\n\nConstruction at the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), the world\u2019s largest fusion device. (Photo: ITER).\n\nThe fusion energy landscape is evolving rapidly. Once confined to experimental research, fusion is now emerging as a strategic national priority for research and development. The [IAEA World Fusion Outlook 2025](https://www.iaea.org/publications/15935/iaea-world-fusion-outlook-2025) publication highlights key developments in fusion energy around the world.\n\n1. Fusion Energy Progress is Accelerating\n-----------------------------------------\n\nFusion has entered a decisive new phase. [ITER](https://www.iter.org/) , the[world\u2019s largest fusion experiment](https://www.iaea.org/bulletin/iter-the-worlds-largest-fusion-experiment), remains the central international endeavour driving scientific and technical progress. A total of 33 nations and thousands of engineers and scientists are collaborating to build and operate a magnetic fusion device called a tokamak, designed to prove the feasibility of fusion as a large scale- carbon free source of energy.\n\nAt the same time, governments, private industry, and utilities are rolling out complementary initiatives that expand the global fusion landscape. New facilities are breaking ground, private-public initiatives are gaining momentum, and regulators are developing bespoke frameworks to keep pace. And end users are signalling growing confidence in the technology through early power purchase agreements.\n\n2. Private Investment Surpasses US $10 Billion\n----------------------------------------------\n\nGlobal private investment in fusion has exceeded US $10 billion, reflecting growing confidence in the sector. Funding is flowing from sovereign wealth funds, major corporations and energy users, supporting a new generation of fusion developers and technologies.\n\n3. Fusion Set to Play Big Role in Future Electricity Mix\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nFusion energy is projected to play a significant role in meeting the world\u2019s growing demand for clean, baseload power. For the first time, the _IAEA World Fusion Outlook_ includes global modelling of fusion energy deployment, conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The study explores how fusion could contribute to the future electricity mix under diverse policy, cost and technological assumptions.\n\nIn the lowest capital cost scenario of US $2.8K/kW in 2050, fusion\u2019s share of electricity generation could reach up to 50% by 2100. Even in the highest cost scenario of US $11.3K/kW, fusion energy is projected to reach 10% of global electricity generation by 2100.\n\nThe modelling also highlights fusion\u2019s economic value: with a rise in demand for clean electricity generation, fusion could add trillions of dollars to global GDP.\n\n4. International Collaboration is Powering Ahead\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThe IAEA\u2019s [World Fusion Energy Group](https://www.iaea.org/events/world-fusion-energy-group-wfeg), established in 2024, is fostering global dialogue and alignment. More than 160 fusion facilities are now operational, under construction or planned, and international cooperation is expanding through multilateral platforms. Although there is currently no globally harmonized definition of a fusion power plant, many jurisdictions recognize the need to establish clear frameworks for fusion machines intended to produce electricity or heat for commercial use.\n\n5. Fusion Technology is Diversifying\n------------------------------------\n\nFusion is advancing through multiple parallel efforts. Building on the foundation established by large scale international collaborations such as ITER, a range of approaches such as tokamaks, stellarators, laser and inertial confinement concepts, magneto-inertial concepts, mirror machines, field reversed configurations, pinches and more, are being developed across public and private sectors. This diversity is driving innovation and strengthening the sector as it searches for pathways toward realizing fusion energy.\n\n6. High-Temperature Superconducting Magnets Enable Smaller Fusion Devices\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe 2025 edition of the _IAEA World Fusion Outlook_ includes a special focus on high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets, which could revolutionize the design of next generation fusion facilities. HTS materials could be used to design more compact and efficient fusion machines, but important design compromises and engineering trade-offs are still needed.\n\nHTS magnets are increasingly being applied across diverse fusion concepts, including tokamaks, stellarators, and mirror machines. Projects such as [SPARC](https://cfs.energy/technology/sparc) and [WHAM](https://wham.physics.wisc.edu/) are integrating HTS coils to enhance performance and reduce size, cost, and development time. Several forthcoming designs are also evaluating HTS technologies as a core component of their systems.\n\nRelated News\n------------\n\n[![Image 3: Card image](http://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/wfeg2025-1600x900.jpeg)](http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/second-ministerial-meeting-of-iaea-world-fusion-energy-group-and-30th-iaea-fusion-energy-conference-take-place-in-chengdu-china)\n\n### [Second Ministerial Meeting of IAEA World Fusion Energy Group and 30th IAEA Fusion Energy Conference Take Place in Chengdu, China](http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/second-ministerial-meeting-of-iaea-world-fusion-energy-group-and-30th-iaea-fusion-energy-conference-take-place-in-chengdu-china)\n\n[![Image 4: Card image](http://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/2025-10/wfeg-publication-fusion-key-elements-square-english.jpg)](http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/iaea-launches-new-world-fusion-outlook-at-opening-of-fusion-events-in-china)\n\n### [IAEA Launches New World Fusion Outlook at Opening of Fusion Events in China](http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/iaea-launches-new-world-fusion-outlook-at-opening-of-fusion-events-in-china)\n\n[![Image 5: Card image](http://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/2024-07/infographic-nuclearfusionweb-story01.jpg)](http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-is-nuclear-fusion)\n\n### [What is Nuclear Fusion?](http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/what-is-nuclear-fusion)\n\nRelated resources\n-----------------\n\n*   [Second Ministerial Meeting of the IAEA World Fusion Energy Group 2025, 14 October 2025](https://www.iaea.org/events/second-ministerial-meeting-of-the-iaea-world-fusion-energy-group-2025)\n*   [Concluding statement](https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/wfeg2025-statement.pdf)\n*   [IAEA Launches New World Fusion Outlook at Opening of Fusion Events in China](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/iaea-launches-new-world-fusion-outlook-at-opening-of-fusion-events-in-china)\n*   [Nuclear Explained \u2013 Is Fusion Energy Possible?](https://www.iaea.org/podcasts/nuclear-explained-is-fusion-energy-possible)\n*   [Do You Know How Nuclear Technology Impacts Our Lives?](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/multimedia/photoessays/do-you-know-how-nuclear-technology-impacts-our-lives)\n*   [The Future of Fusion Energy](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/multimedia/videos/the-future-of-fusion-energy)\n*   [IAEA World Fusion Outlook 2024](https://www.iaea.org/publications/15777/iaea-world-fusion-outlook-2024)\n*   [IAEA World Fusion Outlook 2025](https://www.iaea.org/publications/15935/iaea-world-fusion-outlook-2025)\n*   [IAEA Fusion Energy Conference Opener 2023](https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/multimedia/videos/iaea-fusion-energy-conference-opener-2023)\n\nMore\n----\n\n[Fusion Portal](http://www.iaea.org/resources/databases/fusion-portal)[Department of Nuclear Sciences and Applications](http://www.iaea.org/about/organizational-structure/department-of-nuclear-sciences-and-applications)[Nuclear technology and applications](http://www.iaea.org/topics/nuclear-technology-and-applications)[Division of Physical and Chemical Sciences](http://www.iaea.org/about/organizational-structure/department-of-nuclear-sciences-and-applications/division-of-physical-and-chemical-sciences)[Physics Section](http://www.iaea.org/about/organizational-structure/department-of-nuclear-sciences-and-applications/division-of-physical-and-chemical-sciences/physics-section)[Energy](http://www.iaea.org/topics/energy)[Fusion](http://www.iaea.org/topics/fusion)[Fusion](http://www.iaea.org/topics/fusion)\n\n#### More on the IAEA\n\n1.

    "https://www.agoralab.ai/blog/fusion": "# The Three Major Barriers to Economically Viable Nuclear Fusion: A Comprehensive Analysis\n\nOctober 30, 2024\n\n# The Three Major Barriers to Economically Viable Nuclear Fusion: A Comprehensive Analysis\n\nNuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun and stars, represents humanity's pursuit of what could be the ultimate energy source - clean, safe, and virtually limitless power. However, the gap between laboratory demonstrations and commercially viable fusion power remains substantial. This analysis examines in detail the three most significant barriers to making fusion both economically profitable and practically achievable: the challenge of sustained plasma confinement, the materials science limitations, and the economic hurdles of scaling fusion technology.\n\n## 1. Plasma Confinement and Energy Balance\n\n### The Fundamental Challenge\n\nThe most critical barrier to economically viable fusion is achieving and maintaining the precise conditions necessary for sustained fusion reactions while maintaining a positive energy balance. Current tokamak designs require enormous amounts of energy to create and contain the plasma at fusion conditions, typically around 150 million degrees Celsius for deuterium-tritium fusion.\n\n### Current State of Plasma Confinement\n\nRecent research published in Nuclear Fusion (Chen et al., 2019) demonstrates that energy losses in current experimental reactors occur through multiple mechanisms:\n\n1. Transport Losses: Approximately 45% of energy loss occurs through particle and heat transport across magnetic field lines\n2. Radiation Losses: About 30% through bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation\n3. Edge Effects: 15% through plasma-wall interactions\n4. Other Mechanisms: 10% through various other processes\n\nThe ITER project, while aiming to achieve Q>10 (where Q represents the ratio of fusion power produced to heating power input), has faced numerous technical challenges in its plasma containment systems (ITER Organization, 2023). Detailed analysis of ITER's projected performance indicates that achieving this goal will require:\n\n* Magnetic fields exceeding 11.8 Tesla\n* Plasma current of 15 MA\n* Energy confinement time of 3.7 seconds\n* Plasma density of 1020 particles per cubic meter\n\n### Recent Advances in Confinement Technology\n\nCommonwealth Fusion Systems and MIT's collaboration (Whyte et al., 2022) has demonstrated significant progress with high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets, achieving:\n\n* Field strengths of 20 Tesla in prototype systems\n* Operating temperatures of 20 Kelvin\n* 25% reduction in power requirements compared to traditional superconducting magnets\n* Projected 40% improvement in overall system efficiency\n\nHowever, these advances still face significant challenges:\n\n1. Stability Control\n\n   * Required precision in magnetic field alignment: \u00b10.1%\n   * Maximum allowable field ripple: 0.5%\n   * Plasma position control accuracy: \u00b15mm\n2. Heating Systems\n\n   * Current efficiency of neutral beam injection: 25-30%\n   * RF heating system losses: 40-50%\n   * Required total heating power: 50-100MW\n\n## 2. Materials Science Limitations\n\n### Neutron Degradation\n\nThe impact of neutron damage on reactor materials represents a fundamental challenge that affects both operational capability and economic viability. Research published in the Journal of Nuclear Materials (Thompson et al., 2021) provides detailed analysis of material degradation rates:\n\n#### First Wall Components\n\n* Displacement damage: 20-30 displacements per atom (dpa) per year\n* Helium production: 10-15 appm/dpa\n* Hydrogen production: 45-50 appm/dpa\n* Typical lifetime: 1-2 years before replacement\n\n#### Structural Materials\n\n* Ferritic-martensitic steels show embrittlement at >10 dpa\n* Oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) steels maintain properties up to 80 dpa\n* Vacuum vessel lifetime limited to 5-7 years\n\n### Heat Management Challenges\n\nStudies from the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (Wilson et al., 2020) detail the thermal challenges:\n\n#### Heat Flux Distribution\n\n* Divertor regions: 10-20 MW/m\u00b2\n* First wall: 2-5 MW/m\u00b2\n* Local hot spots: Up to 30 MW/m\u00b2\n\n#### Material Performance\n\n* Tungsten divertor plates:\n  + Maximum operating temperature: 1200\u00b0C\n  + Recrystallization temperature: 1300\u00b0C\n  + Thermal conductivity degradation: 30% after 1 year\n* Carbon-fiber composites:\n  + Erosion rate: 1-2 mm/year\n  + Chemical sputtering yield: 1-2%\n\n### Advanced Materials Development\n\nRecent research in Nature Materials (Zhang et al., 2023) outlines promising developments:\n\n1. Nanostructured Materials\n\n   * Enhanced radiation resistance\n   * 50% improvement in thermal conductivity\n   * Manufacturing scalability challenges\n2. Smart Alloys\n\n   * Self-healing capabilities\n   * Reduced activation compositions\n   * Cost: $500-1000/kg\n3. Composite Solutions\n\n   * Tungsten-copper composites\n   * Improved thermal cycling resistance\n   * Limited availability of raw materials\n\n## 3. Economic and Scaling Challenges\n\n### Capital Costs\n\nThe Fusion Industry Association's 2023 report provides detailed cost breakdowns:\n\n#### Initial Construction Costs\n\n* Magnet systems: 25-30% of total\n* Vacuum vessel: 15-20%\n* Heating systems: 10-15%\n* Buildings and infrastructure: 20-25%\n* Control systems: 10-12%\n\nTotal estimated cost for a 1 GW fusion power plant: $5-10 billion\n\n### Operational Complexity\n\nAnalysis from the Energy Research Partnership (2022) details operational challenges:\n\n#### Staffing Requirements\n\n* Engineers: 150-200 per plant\n* Technicians: 300-400 per plant\n* Support staff: 100-150 per plant\n* Annual labor costs: $75-100 million\n\n#### Maintenance Costs\n\n* Scheduled maintenance: 15-20% of operating costs\n* Component replacement: 25-30% of operating costs\n* Unscheduled downtime: 10-15% of operating time\n\n### Market Competition and Time to Market\n\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (2023) projections indicate:\n\n#### Development Timeline\n\n* First commercial plant: 2040-2045\n* Grid integration: 2045-2050\n* Market maturity: 2055-2060\n\n#### Cost Competitiveness\n\n* Projected initial cost: $150-200/MWh\n* Required cost for market competitiveness: $100 MWh\n* Learning rate: 15-20% cost reduction per doubling of capacity\n\n### Risk Factors and Investment Challenges\n\nRecent analysis by the World Nuclear Association (2023) identifies key risk factors:\n\n1. Technical Risks\n\n   * Probability of technical success: 60-70%\n   * Timeline uncertainty: \u00b15 years\n   * Performance variability: 30-40%\n2. Market Risks\n\n   * Competition from renewable energy\n   * Carbon pricing uncertainty\n   * Grid integration challenges\n3. Regulatory Risks\n\n   * Licensing framework development\n   * Safety standards evolution\n   * Waste management requirements\n\n## Future Prospects and Potential Solutions\n\n### Integrated Approaches\n\nRecent developments suggest several promising pathways:\n\n1.

Executive Summary The pursuit of fusion energy has entered a new and decisive phase, transitioning from a primarily public research endeavour to a dynamic arena for private investment. This first report by the F4E Fusion Observatory provides a comprehensive analysis of this burgeoning sector, revealing a landscape of explosive but highly concentrated growth and offering a perspective on the EU's position within it. This first report from the F4E Observatory has attempted to set out the vibrant and complex landscape of global fusion private investment. Subject to the limitations of the data available and methodology described in the annex, the findings lead to several important conclusions that may help shape future policy decisions: The main findings are: 1. A Rapidly Growing but Concentrated Market. Our analysis using the methodology described in annex 1, shows that global fusion private investment has reached an accumulated total of \u20ac9.9 billion (cutoff 10 June 2025), a more than six-fold increase since 2020. However, this growth is highly concentrated, with the US and China accounting for 85% of all funding. This creates a competitive landscape defined by a few heavily capitalized national ecosystems. 2. The Dominance of US and Chinese Models. The US leads the private race with 38 of 68 private fusion companies and 60% of global funding. China is a strong second, securing 25% of funding with a highly efficient model of only 6 companies. These two dominant models appear to be setting the global pace. 3. The EU's Scaling Challenge. The EU's private ecosystem, with 8 companies and 70 investors, has raised a significant \u20ac567M (~5% of global funding). However, a critical scaling challenge emerges from the data: the average EU investment round is around three times smaller than in the US and 30 times smaller than China. This gap in access to large-scale private capital may be a potential bottleneck for EU advancing towards capital-intensive demonstration phases. 4. A Divergent Technology Strategy. The global private market currently favours magnetic confinement fusion (70% of funding). The EU private sector instead allocates most funding (69%) to inertial confinement. This shows an important difference in the EU ecosystem and may be a result of the availability of stable public funding for magnetic confinement fusion in the EU (a subject for future analysis). 5. A Negative Cross-Border Investment Balance. The EU's negative investment balance of 74M\u20ac (105M\u20ac with the US), while demonstrating the global reach of its investors, indicates that EU capital is also contributing to the growth of a fusion ecosystems outside the EU. This probably reflects the attractiveness of the more mature US venture market but could also be an indication of a lack of investable fusion projects within the EU. Again, this may be due to the availability of stable public funding sources for magnetic fusion initiatives within the EU (to be further explored). Global Investment in the Private Fusion Sector \u2013 F4E Observatory Report (1st Edition, 10 June 2025) IDM Reference: F4E_D_BWWWM Page 5/22 6. The Central Strategic Duality: Industrial Strength and Private Sector Scale. An important conclusion is that the EU's position is one of strategic duality. In contrast to the US where privately funded fusion initiatives are dominant, the \u20ac6.8 billion public investment in the EU ITER supply chain though F4E has created a foundational asset of unparalleled value, a world-class industrial base. However, aside from spinoff applications outside fusion, the long-term sustainability of these supply chains depends on a future fusion technologies market and commercial fusion plants, and this may be one of the main challenges facing the EU in the coming years. Note that this analysis does not consider public sector funding to national public fusion initiatives that remains an important component of the overall fusion landscape (this will be the subject of ongoing analysis and future reports). This may help to explain some of the trends seen in this report including the allocation of investment to different fusion concepts and technologies where, for example, EU private sector investment is focussed on inertial confinement and magnetic confinement in other regions. Global Investment in the Private Fusion Sector \u2013 F4E Observatory Report (1st Edition, 10 June 2025) IDM Reference: F4E_D_BWWWM Page 6/22 2. Global Investment Overview The overall evolution of cumulative investment in private sector fusion companies (Figures 1 and 2) shows an inflection point from just over \u20ac1.5 billion in 2020 to an estimated \u20ac9.9 billion today (cutoff 10 June 2025). This funding is a mix of sources: private capital accounts for the majority at over \u20ac6.7 billion, but public funds, totalling around \u20ac1.8 billion, are increasingly flowing into private ventures through grants and institutional support. A further \u20ac1.4 billion comes from hybrid forms like Public-Private Partnerships and state-backed investments, particularly in China and the US. Figure 1 - Progressive growth of Global Investments in Fusion Companies (2000-Present) Figure 2 \u2013 Stacked chart showing annual in investments in fusion companies by country Global Investment in the Private Fusion Sector \u2013 F4E Observatory Report (1st Edition, 10 June 2025) IDM Reference: F4E_D_BWWWM Page 7/22 A global map of the \u20ac9.9 billion in total funding (Figure 3) reveals a landscape dominated by two primary hubs: North America (\u20ac6.3B) and East Asia (\u20ac2.5B). A more detailed breakdown by country (Figure 4) sharpens this picture. The United States leads with \u20ac6.1 billion (61.3%), while China follows with \u20ac2.4 billion (24.4%). Together, these two nations account for 85% of all private fusion funding, creating a duopolistic structure at the top of the market. Figure 3 \u2013 Geographical Global Investment Overview by Country (Millions of EUR) Figure 4 \u2013 Breakdown of global Investments by Country of Fusion Company (Millions of EUR) Global Investment in the Private Fusion Sector \u2013 F4E Observatory Report (1st Edition, 10 June 2025) IDM Reference: F4E_D_BWWWM Page 8/22 Within Europe (Figures 5 and 6), investment is nearly evenly split between the United Kingdom (\u20ac416.8M) and the surveyed EU member states. Germany is the clear leader within the EU, with its companies raising \u20ac460.5M, or 81% of total of investments in the EU, indicating that the EU's private ecosystem is not only smaller but also less geographically diversified than that of the US. Figure 5 - Investments by Country in Europe (Millions of EUR) Figure 6 \u2013 Geographic Investment Overview in Europe (Millions of EUR) Global Investment in the Private Fusion Sector \u2013 F4E Observatory Report (1st Edition, 10 June 2025) IDM Reference: F4E_D_BWWWM Page 9/22 This financial landscape is reflected in company demographics (Figures 7 and 8). The US hosts 38 of the 68 companies tracked, indicating a mature ecosystem with a high degree of \"critical mass.\" The EU is home to 8 companies. Figure 7 - Number and Location of Companies Globally Figure 8 - Number and Location of Companies in Europe Global Investment in the Private Fusion Sector \u2013 F4E Observatory Report (1st Edition, 10 June 2025) IDM Reference: F4E_D_BWWWM Page 10/22 This concentration of capital has produced some titans (Figure 9) like NEO Fusion (China, \u20ac1.9B) and Commonwealth Fusion Systems (USA, \u20ac1.8B). These are followed closely by US-based TAE Technologies (\u20ac1.3B), Helion Energy (\u20ac906M), and Pacific Fusion (\u20ac831M). Remarkably, these five companies alone account for nearly 70% of all global private investment. It is also notable that these firms are not only technology leaders but are also tightly embedded in national innovation and energy strategies, having also received significant government support. Figure 9 - Top-Funded Fusion Companies Worldwide1 In the European context (Figure 10), the leading companies operate at a different financial scale. The UK's Tokamak Energy (\u20ac307.4M) is the most well-funded, followed by Marvel Fusion (\u20ac255.8M) and Focused Energy (\u20ac115M)\u2014both based in Germany but with strong operational ties to the US. The list continues with First Light Fusion (\u20ac103.7M) and a cluster of emerging ventures like Proxima Fusion (\u20ac62M) and Renaissance Fusion (\u20ac61M). While these firms are advancing rapidly with innovative technologies, their capital levels are still between 10 and 20 times lower than their American or Chinese counterparts. 1 Company logos shown for informational purposes only.

Investors Landscape The sources of capital reveal distinct regional investment philosophies. As illustrated in the comparative charts of Figure 11, three models emerge: \u2022 A venture-led model in the United States, where private capital (91.9%) is the primary engine of growth. \u2022 A state-guided model in China, where public and public-private funding (77.3%) reflect a top-down industrial strategy. \u2022 A hybrid model in the European Union, with a balanced mix of public (28.0%), private (31.9%), and public-private (40.0%) funding. Figure 11 \u2013 Investors Type in the United States, China and the European Union Globally (Figure 12), US-based investors are the primary source of capital, deploying \u20ac5.157 billion (56.4%). Within the EU (Figure 13), the investor base is more localised, led by German (40%) and French (16.4%) investors. The key investor groups in each region are highlighted in Figure 14. This global flow of capital, detailed in Figure 15, results in a negative investment balance for the EU. As concluded in this report's findings, the EU has an overall negative cross-border investment balance of 74M\u20ac with 105M\u20ac with the US alone, indicating that European capital is actively supporting the growth of a fusion ecosystems outside the EU.

Technology Focus At a global level (Figure 16), private investment has shown a clear preference for Magnetic Confinement Fusion (MCF), attracting \u20ac6.235 billion. Within this category (Figure 17), the Tokamak concept leads with \u20ac3.803 billion, underscoring the profound influence of large public projects like ITER on private sector confidence. Figure 16 \u2013 Funding by Technology Family \u2013 Global level Figure 17 \u2013 Focus on Magnetic Confinement Fusion \u2013 Global level Global Investment in the Private Fusion Sector \u2013 F4E Observatory Report (1st Edition, 10 June 2025) IDM Reference: F4E_D_BWWWM Page 16/22 A striking strategic divergence emerges at the regional level (Figures 18, 19, 20). Both North America and East Asia have mirrored the global trend, directing most of their investment toward MCF. The EU stands in stark contrast. Here, the private investment landscape is inverted, with Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) attracting \u20ac390 million, more than double the amount invested in MCF companies. This shows the EU private sector charting a different course, exploring alternative pathways.

ITER Supply Chain An analysis focused solely on the investment in private sector fusion companies provides an incomplete perspective on Europe's true position. Apart from the (mostly) publicly funded public sector fusion activities (laboratories and research organisations) that will be subject to future analysis by the F4E Observatory, it is important to consider the investments being made in industrial supply chains to fabricate components for the ITER international fusion project. With the EU responsible for 45% of the total in-kind contributions to the ITER project, the investment in the supply chain has been substantial. Figure 21 shows the annual amounts awarded by F4E mostly through ~1300 contracts to EU industry, amounting to a total of \u20ac6.822 billion for the period since 2007 when ITER procurement started. The scope of these contracts is broad and includes superconducting magnets, vacuum vessels, civil engineering, cryogenics, diagnostics, robotics, etc. Considering the broader picture of both the investment in private sector fusion companies in sections 2 and 3 of this report and the ITER supply chain investments from this section, it is possible to perform a comparative analysis of the EU and the US. According to the US ITER Update (February 2025), more than $1.4 billion is invested in the US fusion supply chain. One can therefore compare the overall funding in figure 22. The totals are coincidentally similar but show the striking difference between the two ecosystems. Note that the value of the ITER supply chain in both the EU and US is underestimated since this does not contracts awarded directly by the ITER International Organisation. Global Investment in the Private Fusion Sector \u2013 F4E Observatory Report (1st Edition, 10 June 2025) IDM Reference: F4E_D_BWWWM Page 18/22 Figure 21 \u2013 Annual (orange bars) and cumulative (green line) investment in EU supply chain by F4E Figure 22 \u2013 Comparison of Investment in Private Fusion Companies and the ITER Supply Chain in the EU and US4 4 https://usiter.ornl.gov/iter-project/ Global Investment in the Private Fusion Sector \u2013 F4E Observatory Report (1st Edition, 10 June 2025) IDM Reference: F4E_D_BWWWM Page 19/22 Clearly this shows the respective strengths of each region: the US is building momentum in private fusion innovation whereas the EU has built a high-performance industrial supply chain through public procurement and coordination. That said, one must be careful with this comparison - investment in the supply chain, while substantial, has a different kind of impact than equity in a fast-scaling fusion company. For instance, it does not necessarily translate into the same level of innovation, IP ownership, or investor confidence. One must also recognise that supply chains established for the supply of a component or service under contractual terms, may not be sustained after the contract ends. Global Investment in the Private Fusion Sector \u2013 F4E Observatory Report (1st Edition, 10 June 2025) IDM Reference: F4E_D_BWWWM Page 20/22 Annex Description of the Methodology Used The F4E Fusion Observatory utilizes a multi\u2010step, rigorous process to collect, validate, and analyse all funding data for private fusion companies. By integrating diverse data sources, applying consistent currency conversions, and categorizing each investment both by technology and by financing type, the Observatory ensures that its findings are reliable, transparent, and readily comparable across companies, regions, and time periods. Data Sourcing Our core dataset is compiled from publicly available releases, dedicated fusion\u2010industry databases (notably FusionXInvest and Fusion Energy Base), reputable press articles, and official company announcements. To guarantee data fidelity, each funding event is cross\u2010checked across at least two independent sources. Whenever conflicting figures arise (e.g., differing round sizes or divergent dates), we undertake targeted follow-up investigations, scrutinizing additional press coverage, consulting official regulatory filings, or reaching out directly to company representatives, to arrive at the most accurate estimate. \u2022 INFUSE Grant Estimates: Certain public grants (such as those awarded by Fusion Energy Sciences via the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s INFUSE program) are not broken down by individual beneficiary. In these cases, FusionXInvest\u2010derived allocations are used as proxies, since DOE reports only the aggregate sum. \u2022 Company Location Tagging: For organizations operating in multiple jurisdictions, we assign \u201cprimary location\u201d based on the company\u2019s main economic activity (i.e., where most R&D or manufacturing occurs). This ensures that regional analyses reflect each company\u2019s genuine operational footprint. Investment Values & Currency Conversion All investment amounts are standardized in euros (EUR) to facilitate apples-to-apples comparisons. When a European company discloses an amount already denominated in EUR, we accept that figure as is, no further conversion is applied. For non-European companies, each foreign\u2010currency investment (typically reported in USD, GBP, CNY, or JPY) is converted to EUR using the European Central Bank\u2019s reference exchange rate for the year in which the funding was announced. If the announcement date is unavailable, the company\u2019s founding year serves as a proxy to select an appropriate annual rate. This approach preserves historical context \u2013 accounting, for example, for periods of currency volatility \u2013 so that year-over-year trends remain meaningful. Technological Approach & Classification Each entity is classified according to its primary \u201ctechnology family\u201d using a taxonomy derived from authoritative sources (IAEA World Fusion Outlook 2024, IAEA Fusion Key Elements, peer-reviewed literature) and validated via F4E\u2019s internal expert review. This hierarchical structure allows us to group companies and investments into well-defined categories: Global Investment in the Private Fusion Sector \u2013 F4E Observatory Report (1st Edition, 10 June 2025) IDM Reference: F4E_D_BWWWM Page 21/22 1. Magnetic Confinement Fusion (MCF) \u2013 Sub-technologies: Tokamak, Spherical Tokamak, Stellarator (and variants such as Quasi-isodynamic and Dynamic Stellarator), Field-Reversed Configuration (FRC), Magnetic Mirror (and subtypes like Centrifugal Magnetic Mirror), Closed Orbit, Levitated Dipole, Electro-centripetal confinement, Plasma Fusion Propulsion. 2. Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) \u2013 Sub-technologies: Laser-driven ICF (short-pulse or shock-driven), Shock-driven inertial confinement. 3. Magneto-Inertial Fusion (MIF) \u2013 Sub-technologies: Z-pinch, Dense Plasma Focus, Plasma Jet\u2013Driven MIF (PJMIF), Magnetized Target Fusion, Pulsed Magneto-Plasma Pressurized Confinement, Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion (MagLIF), Pulsed Magnetic Fusion. 4. Alternative Concepts \u2013 Sub-technologies: Muon-catalyzed fusion, Lattice Confinement Fusion (LCF), Magnetic-electrostatic confinement, Electrostatic Confinement, Beam-target Fusion (beam-solid, beam-gas, beam-plasma), Proprietary confinement designs, Aneutronic Fusion, Plectoneme, Spindle Cusp, Superconducting Shielded-grid Inertial Electrostatic Confinement, Direct laser\u2013driven pB11, Miniaturized reactor concepts. This classification ensures that we can accurately quantify how much funding each fusion approach has attracted \u2013 both globally and within Europe \u2013 as well as track shifts in technological preference over time. Funding Categorization (Equity, Grant, Convertible, etc.) To analyse the financing mix, we assign each funding event to one of five \u201cInvestment Type\u201d buckets based on keywords in source disclosures and investor identities: \u2022 Equity: Deals labelled \u201cequity\u201d or where terms such as \u201cSeries A/B/C,\u201d \u201cVC,\u201d \u201cSeed,\u201d \u201cPre-Seed,\u201d or \u201cCrowdfunding\u201d appear. \u2022 Grant/Subsidy: Transactions explicitly described as \u201cgrant,\u201d \u201csubsidy,\u201d or \u201cfunded by government.\u201d \u2022 Convertible: Rounds designated as \u201cSAFE\u201d (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) or \u201cconvertible note.\u201d \u2022 Prize/Award: Non-dilutive awards labelled \u201cprize\u201d or \u201caward.\u201d \u2022 Corporate Strategic: Investments made by known strategic corporations (e.g., Eni, Chevron, Google) that are clearly tied to a corporate innovation or R&D mandate. \u2022 Unknown: Any rounding that cannot be conclusively assigned to one of the above categories. This classification facilitates comparative analysis of how much funding originates from venture capital versus direct government grants or strategic corporate investors. Public vs. Private vs. Public-Private Partnerships Each organization is tagged as \u201cprivate\u201d only if it is majority-owned by non-governmental entities and not listed on any public exchange. If a company receives funding directly from government agencies (grants, awards) or operates under a mixed public-private structure (e.g., a consortium partially owned by a national laboratory), it is classified accordingly: \u2022 Private: Majority-privately owned fusion enterprises. \u2022 Public: Entities primarily funded or operated by government bodies (e.g., national labs, university spinouts still majority-government-controlled). Global Investment in the Private Fusion Sector \u2013 F4E Observatory Report (1st Edition, 10 June 2025) IDM Reference: F4E_D_BWWWM Page 22/22 \u2022 Public-Private Partnerships: Joint ventures or collaborative R&D projects where public funding is explicitly tied to private-sector commercialization goals. This triage allows the Observatory to isolate pure private-sector momentum from state-led initiatives and joint government-industry collaborations. The Observatory uses a three-tier classification to categorize the nature of each investment: Public, Private, and Public-Private. It is important to clarify that the label \u201cPublic-Private\u201d in our graphs does not necessarily imply the existence of a formal Public-Private Partnership (PPP) or joint venture. Instead, it indicates cases where both public and private entities participated in the same funding round, regardless of whether a formal collaboration structure was in place. This distinction helps capture the growing role of public support for private ventures without overstating the institutional relationships behind them. Data Management & Validation Tools All raw transactions and metadata are first compiled in a master Excel workbook, which is tightly integrated with Microsoft Copilot to automate routine tasks, such as flagging missing data, suggesting potential outliers, and cross-referencing investor names across multiple rounds. Once cleaned and normalized, the dataset is imported into Power BI, enabling dynamic dashboards that reveal funding trends by year, by region, by technology family, and by investor type. An in-house AI tagging engine assists with technology classification (e.g., parsing press releases to confirm that a company\u2019s \u201cprimary approach\u201d is indeed \u201cmagnetic confinement fusion\u201d). This combination of human oversight and AI\u2010 guided tooling ensures that our methodology remains both thorough and repeatable.",

is an EU regulation which entered into force on 2 August 2024 and is directly applicable across the EU. The regulation applies in a phased manner over 36 months from entry into force.\n\nThe regulation is designed to provide a high level of protection to people\u2019s health, safety and fundamental rights, and to promote the adoption of human-centric, trustworthy AI. It will provide a harmonised regulatory framework for AI systems placed on the market, or deployed, in the EU.\n\nThe Act applies equally to uses of AI in the public service as to the private sector. However, it provides exemptions for certain applications of AI relating to national defence; national security; scientific R&D; R&D for AI systems, models; open-sourced models; and personal use.\n\nThe Act is not a blanket regulation applying to all AI systems. Rather, it adopts a risk-based approach to regulation, based on four risk categories in order to ensure that its measures are targeted and proportionate. The Act also makes allowance for the unique circumstances of SMEs. The four risk categories are described in the next section.\n\n**Risk hierarchy underpinning the EU AI Act**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n![Image 2: AI Act risk hierarchy ](https://enterprise.gov.ie/images_upload/djei/en/imagelibrary/pyramid_7F5843E5-9386-8052-931F5C4E98C6E5F2_75757.jpg)\n\n_Source: European Commission_\n\n### **Unacceptable risk**\n\nThese are a set of eight harmful uses of AI that contravene EU values because they violate fundamental rights. These AI uses will be prohibited and include:\n\n*   subliminal techniques likely to cause a person, or another, significant harm\n*   exploiting vulnerabilities due to age, disability or social or economic situation\n*   social scoring leading to disproportionate detrimental or unfavourable treatment\n*   profiling individuals for prediction of criminal activity\n*   untargeted scraping of facial image\n*   inferring emotions in work or education\n*   biometric categorisation of race, religion, sexual orientation\n*   real-time remote biometric identification for law enforcement purposes\n\nThe prohibitions on uses with unacceptable risk apply from February 2025. Reference guidelines for the application of these provisions of the AI Act have been published by the European Commission:\n\n[Guidelines on prohibited AI practices as defined by the AI Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/commission-publishes-guidelines-prohibited-artificial-intelligence-ai-practices-defined-ai-act)\n\n### **High risk**\n\nThe first category relates to the use of AI systems that are safety components of products, or which are themselves products, falling within the scope of certain Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex I of the Act, for example toys and machinery.\n\nThe provisions on product-linked high-risk AI systems apply from August 2027.\n\nThe second category relates to eight specific high-risk uses of AI listed in Annex III of the Act. These are AI systems that potentially create an adverse impact on people's safety or their fundamental rights, as protected by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and are high-risk.\n\nThe provisions on high-risk uses apply from August 2026.You can view classifications rules for high-risk AI systems on [AI Act Explorer](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act-explorer).\n\n### **Specific transparency risk**\n\nThe AI Act introduces specific transparency requirements for certain AI applications where, for example, there is a clear risk of manipulation such as the use of chatbots or deepfakes. You can view Article 50 for transparency obligations at[Article 50: Transparency obligations for providers and deployers of certain AI systems](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/ai-act/article-50).\n\n### **Minimal risk**\n\nMost AI systems will only give rise to minimal risks and consequently, can be marketed and used subject to the existing legislation without additional legal obligations under the AI Act.\n\n**General-purpose AI models**\n-----------------------------\n\nGeneral-purpose AI (GPAI) models, often referred to as foundational models, exhibit significant generality and are capable of competently performing a wide range of distinct tasks. As a consequence of this power, they pose unique risks, including systemic risks to the EU. For this reason, there are specific provisions and obligations applying to GPAI models under the AI Act. The European Commission, through its AI Office, is responsible for enforcing these provisions.\n\nFurther information on GPAI modules can be found on the[AI Act Single Information Platform](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en).\n\n**Rules for AI systems**\n------------------------\n\nThe AI Act introduces rules for certain AI systems placed on the market, or deployed, in the EU to mitigate the risks to people\u2019s health, safety and fundamental rights. These rules relate to, certification of AI systems\u2019 conformance with standards; governance of AI systems during development; and supervision of systems when in use.\n\nThe key responsibilities under the Act lie with _providers_ and _deployers_ of AI systems. However, there are also responsibilities for other actors in the supply chain:_importers_,_distributors_, and _authorised representatives_.\n\n**Application of the Act**\n--------------------------\n\nThe provisions of the EU AI Act apply in a phased manner from its entry into force in August 2024.\n\nKey milestones include:\n\n*   **2 November 2024**\n\nMember states must identify public bodies which supervise or enforce fundamental rights in relation to the use of high-risk AI systems referred to in Annex III and make the list publicly available.\n\nRelated press release:[Key milestone in the implementation of the EU regulation on AI](https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/news-and-events/department-news/2024/october/31102024.html)\n\n*   **2 February 2025**\n\nRules on prohibited AI practices come into effect.\n\nProviders and deployers must ensure their staff have a sufficient level of AI literacy.\n\n*   **2 August 2025**\n\nMember states must designate competent authorities for the purposes of the Act.\n\nMember states must legislate for penalties for infringements of the Act.\n\n*   **2 August 2026**\n\nMember states must have an operational AI Regulatory Sandbox to support innovation.\n\nRules on high-risk AI systems (use cases - Annex III) come into effect.\n\n*   **2 August 2027**\n\nRules on high-risk AI systems (products/Annex I) come into effect.\n\nPenalties\n---------\n\nFor infringements of the rules for AI systems, the EU AI Act sets out the maximum applicable penalties as below:\n\n*   up to \u20ac35 million or 7% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year (whichever is higher) for infringements on prohibited practices or non-compliance related to requirements on data\n*   up to \u20ac15 million or 3% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year for non-compliance with any of the other requirements or obligations of the Act\n*   up to \u20ac7.5 million or 1.5% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year for the supply of incorrect, incomplete or misleading information to notified bodies and national competent authorities in reply to a request from a competent authority\n\nFor each category of infringement, the threshold would be the lower of the two amounts for SMEs, and the higher for other companies.\n\nCompetent authorities and Single Point of Contact (SPoC)\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Irish Government decided that Ireland adopt a distributed model of implementation of the EU AI Act, building on the capacity and expertise of established sectoral regulators.\n\nA new AI Office of Ireland will be established as a central and coordinating authority, by August 2026, for the implementation of the AI Act in Ireland. It will provide a focal point for the promotion and adoption of transparent and safe AI in Ireland, to ensure that we fully capture the strategic opportunity that AI presents.\n\nThe AI Office acting as the central coordinating authority for the AI Act will:\n\n*   co-ordinate Competent Authority activities to ensure consistent implementation of the EU AI Act\n*   serve as the single point of contact for the EU AI Act\n*   facilitate centralised access to technical expertise by the other competent authorities, as required\n*   drive AI innovation and adoption through the hosting of a regulatory sandbox and act as a focal point for AI in Ireland, encompassing regulation, innovation and deployment\n\nThe Competent Authorities currently designated under the EU AI Act are:\n\n*   Central Bank of Ireland\n*   Coimisi\u00fan na Me\u00e1n\n*   Commission for Communications Regulation\n*   Commission for Railway Regulation\n*   Commission for Regulation of Utilities\n*   Competition and Consumer Protection Commission\n*   Data Protection Commission\n*   Health and Safety Authority\n*   Health Products Regulatory Authority\n*   Health Services Executive\n*   Marine Survey Office of the Department of Transport\n*   Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment\n*   Minister for Transport\n*   National Transport Authority\n*   Workplace Relations Commission\n\nPublic authorities which supervise or enforce obligations protecting fundamental rights\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArticle 77 of the AI Act requires that Member States of the EU identify national public authorities which supervise or enforce the respect of obligations under Union law protecting fundamental rights, including the right to non-discrimination, in relation to certain high-risk uses of AI systems specified in the Act. Under the Act, fundamental rights are those enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection.\n\nIreland\u2019s list of fundamental rights authorities identified in accordance with Article 77 of the AI Act is as follows:\n\n*   [An Coimisi\u00fan Toghch\u00e1in](https://www.electoralcommission.ie/)\n*   [Coimisi\u00fan na Me\u00e1n](https://www.cnam.ie/)\n*   [Data Protection Commission](https://www.dataprotection.ie/en)\n*   [Environmental Protection Authority](https://www.epa.ie/)\n*   [Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman](https://www.fspo.ie/)\n*   [Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission](https://www.ihrec.ie/)\n*   [Ombudsman](https://www.ombudsman.ie/en/)\n*   [Ombudsman for Children\u2019s Office](https://www.oco.ie/)\n*   [Ombudsman for the Defence Forces](https://www.odf.ie/)\n\nThese authorities are not Competent Authorities for the AI Act, nor are any obligations, responsibilities or tasks assigned to them under the AI Act.\n\nRather, these authorities will get additional powers to facilitate them in carrying out their current mandates in circumstances involving the use of AI systems. For example, the authorities will have the power to access documentation that developers and deployers of AI systems are required to hold under the AI Act. These powers will apply from 2 August 2026.\n\nEU Single Information Platform- AI Act Service Desk\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nThe European Commissions\u2019 [Single Information Platform](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en), provides online interactive tools to help stakeholders determine whether they are subject to legal obligations and understand the steps they need to take to comply.\n\nThe platform is part of the EU AI Act Service Desk,launched on 8 October 2025 as a central initiative to help stakeholders navigate the AI Act requirements. It serves as an accessible, up-to-date information hub offering clear guidance on the AI Act\u2019s application.\n\nThe [AI Act Compliance Checker](https://ai-act-service-desk.ec.europa.eu/en/eu-ai-act-compliance-checker) is a tool crafted to clarify the obligations and requirements of the AI Act.\n\nEU Digital Omnibus\n------------------\n\nThe EU Digital Omnibus (19 November 2025) proposes targeted amendments across the EU's data protection, data sharing, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence legislative frameworks to reduce duplicative obligations and clarify how the rules interact. The proposed changes aim to reduce compliance costs for businesses throughout the EU, support competitiveness and drive innovation.\n\nIt is a first step to optimise the application of the digital rulebook.\n\nFurther details on the Digital Omnibus can be found on[Digital Package - Shaping Europe\u2019s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/faqs/digital-package).\n\nFurther information\n-------------------\n\n[AI Act - European Commission](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai)\n\n[AI Act Q&As - European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_1683)\n\n[Full text of the AI Act:Regulation (EU) 2024/1689](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1689/oj)\n\n[European AI Office - European Commission](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-office)\n\n### AI literacy\n\nIntroduction to AI Course - increase your awareness of AI, learn about the EU AI Act and support adoption of AI in your organisation:[Skills and training - AI for You - CeADAR](https://ceadar.ie/edih/skills-and-training/)\n\n### **Single point of contact**\n\nFurther guidance and clarification is expected from the European Commission over the coming months.

    "https://www.aon.com/en/insights/articles/new-us-executive-order-on-artificial-intelligence": "# Policy Alert: New U.S. Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence \u2013 Aon Tips for Better Risk Capital Decisions\n\nPolicy Alert: New U.S. Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence \u2013 Aon Tips for Better Risk Capital Decisions\n\nJanuary 30, 2026 9 mins\n\n## Policy Alert: New U.S. Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence \u2013 Aon Tips for Better Risk Capital Decisions\n\n#### On December 11, 2025, U.S. President Donald J. Trump released a new Federal Executive Order \u2014 the latest effort towards the aggressive promotion of U.S. AI leadership and away from a fragmented, state-by-state regulatory model.\n\n###### Better Informed\n\nOn December 11, 2025, U.S. President Donald J. Trump released a new Federal Executive Order \u2014 the latest effort towards the aggressive promotion of U.S. AI leadership and away from a fragmented, state-by-state regulatory model. At its core, the Executive Order, titled \u201cEnsuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence,\u201d does three things:\n\n1. *Declares a national policy:* The U.S. will pursue \u201cminimally burdensome\u201d AI regulation to sustain and enhance global AI dominance.\n2. *Targets state-level AI rules:* It creates tools and incentives to challenge or constrain state AI laws seen as \u201conerous,\u201d especially those perceived as forcing \u201cideological bias\u201d into models, requiring changes to \u201ctruthful outputs\u201d of AI, or imposing extensive reporting and disclosure obligations.\n3. *Sets the stage for a uniform federal framework:* It directs the Administration to prepare legislation that preempts conflicting state AI laws, while carving out limited areas like child safety and state procurement.\n\nThe Administration has framed AI as central to U.S. national security and economic dominance, and explicitly rejects what it sees as over-regulation, particularly at the state level.\n\n* To create a policy environment that favors rapid AI deployment, experimentation, and capital investment, the **Department of Justice**(DOJ) will in the next 30 days create an AI Litigation Task Force whose \u201csole responsibility\u201d is to challenge state AI laws deemed inconsistent with the Executive Order\u2019s policy.\n* Within 90 days, the **Department of Commerce** (Commerce) must publish an evaluation of state AI laws that flags \u201conerous\u201d laws that are inconsistent with the Executive Order\u2019s policy. These will include laws that require AI to alter truthful outputs and compel disclosure and reporting that may violate First Amendment or other provisions of the Constitution.\n* Prospectively, prevents states with \u201conerous\u201d AI laws from accessing certain Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program (BEAD) funds, essentially using federal funding to discourage state AI regulations that are inconsistent with the Executive Order. This could create near-term uncertainty in states that currently have stricter AI regulation.\n* To create a default national disclosure framework for certain AI systems, **the Federal Communications Commission** (FCC) has been directed to consider a federal reporting and disclosure standard for AI models that preempts conflicting state rules.\n* **The Federal Trade Commission** (FTC) will issue a policy statement explaining when state laws that require altering truthful AI outputs will be treated as preempted by federal law on unfair and deceptive practices.\n* And lastly, **the Administration** will draft legislation for a uniform federal AI policy that preempts state AI laws conflicting with the Executive Order\u2019s policy, leading to organizations facing one primary federal AI regime for commercial use plus limited, clearly scoped state rules in exempted areas like child safety and public-sector AI.\n\nFor organizations with operations across the U.S., this is not just a legal development. It will influence the enterprise risk profile, control environment and insurability of AI-enabled activities over the next several years. A more uniform AI framework could reduce regulatory friction and compliance cost, but it also raises questions around governance, liability allocation and stakeholder trust in AI-driven decisions.\n\nThis new direction aligns with themes highlighted by Kevin Kalinich, Aon\u2019s Intangible Assets Global Collaboration Leader, during his Congressional Testimony regarding artificial intelligence, which emphasized that national standards and clearly defined \u201csafe harbors\u201d can reduce legal uncertainty and encourage responsible innovation, similar to how some state and federal laws use the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\u00a0AI Risk Management Framework and other benchmarks to guide risk mitigation. The Texas AI law, for instance, will enable more confident use of AI because, among other things, it provides some protection for entities that comply with the NIST AI Risk Management Framework. Similarly, Last week, Florida rolled out a proposal for a \u201cCitizen Bill of Rights for Artificial Intelligence\u201d aimed at protecting consumers from the potential risks and harms that come with AI.3\n\nFurthermore, under The McCarran-Ferguson Act, insurance regulation and taxation are primarily delegated under state authority, not the federal government, stating that state regulation is in the public interest and supersedes federal laws unless Congress acts specifically against it. This Act established the modern state-based system for regulating the insurance industry, such as AI safety guidelines. For example, The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) issued the Model Bulletin on the Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems by Insurers in December 2023, which has been adopted by over half of the states.4\n\n###### Related Insights\n\n* [How Artificial Intelligence is Transforming Human Resources and the Workforce](/en/insights/articles/how-artificial-intelligence-is-transforming-human-resources-and-the-workforce)\n* Article\n\n  [How AI and Workforce will Intersect: Navigating Risks and Opportunities](/en/insights/client-trends/workforce-technology)\n* Article\n\n  [AI and Workforce Skills: Who Should Act and Why Now?](/en/insights/articles/ai-and-workforce-skills-who-should-act-and-why-now)\n\n###### Better Advised\n\nArtificial intelligence opportunities, perils and Risk Capital solutions are dynamic and fluid. What should organizations consider to maximize their AI return on investment and minimize their total cost of risk?\n\nIn the short term, organizations should expect to see greater volatility and legal uncertainty in the market as new state laws continue to emerge5, the DOJ\u2019s Task Force begins challenging selected laws, and federal agencies (FCC6, FTC7, Commerce8) begin to issue standards, evaluations, and policy statements. Organizations will need to activate monitoring and scenario planning for situations where state obligations may be invalidated or narrowed, how rapidly federal preemption efforts progress and changes to disclosure, transparency and reporting obligations. In addition, the Executive Order is likely to face legal challenges as to its constitutionality, which may ultimately impact the Order\u2019s scope and impact.\n\nIn the medium term \u2014 over the next several years \u2014 organizations may expect to see a convergence toward a federal-first AI regime with fewer diverging state requirements to design around and more predictable compliance architecture for multi-state operations. Seeing how the U.S. regime rules compare to global rules around AI will cause organizations to make strategic decisions around deployment of AI globally. For example, organizations that operate globally must still comply with foreign regulations, such as the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act and all other applicable laws.\n\nIf a federal framework emerges that:\n\n* Differentiates **higher-risk vs. lower-risk AI uses**\n* Embeds **clear governance and technical control expectations**\n* Potentially provides **safe harbor-style protections** for entities that align to recognized standards\n\nthen enterprises could benefit from:\n\n* **Greater confidence in scaling AI from pilots to production,** knowing that liability parameters and oversight expectations are more clearly defined.\n* **Reduced compliance fragmentation and associated costs** across states.\n* **More consistent risk quantification and transfer,** including better integration of AI risk into insurance and captive strategies.\n* Stronger **enterprise wide AI governance models,** integrating legal, risk, cyber, operations and business units, in line with emerging best practices.\n\n###### Better Decisions\n\nThis Executive Order marks a clear strategic choice by the federal government to promote U.S. AI leadership by reducing perceived state-level barriers and moving toward a more uniform, \u201cminimally burdensome\u201d regime. For organizations, this allows for faster AI adoption and fewer long-term regulatory inconsistencies across states, coupled with a shift in heavy compliance and reporting obligations to something less onerous. Organizations that:\n\n* Establish risk\u2011based AI governance\n* Align to emerging standards and safe harbor concepts\n* Integrate AI into enterprise-level risk, resilience and disclosure frameworks\n\nwill be better positioned to capture AI-driven growth while managing the evolving landscape of liability, reputation, and operational risk.\n\nBoards, executive teams and risk leaders should consider the following cross sector priorities:\n\n###### 1. Develop an Enterprise AI Use\u2011Case Inventory\n\n* Catalog AI systems and use cases across the organization, including those embedded in third-party tools.\n* Classify use cases by **business criticality and risk,** separating high impact decisions from lower risk automation.\n\n###### 2. Enhance AI Governance and Controls\n\n* Build or refine an **AI governance framework**that connects legal, compliance, cyber, data, operational risk and business owners.\n* Align policies and controls with **recognized risk management frameworks** likely to underpin safe harbors and emerging federal standards.\n\n###### 3. Review Contracts and Risk Transfer Arrangements\n\n* Revisit **key vendor and partner agreements**involving AI, data and models to ensure clarity on responsibilities, performance, security and compliance.\n* Assess how AI related risks are addressed in existing **insurance programs** (e.g., cyber, E&O, D&O, media / tech liability, Employee Practices Liability Insurance, General/Product Liability, Crime \u2013 e.g. deep fake fraudulent funds transfers, etc.) and consider enhancements as the market for AI specific coverages evolves.[9] Compare advantages and disadvantages of assumed \u201cSilent AI\u201d coverage under existing coverage versus affirmative AI coverage in midst of growing specific AI exclusions and sub-limits.\n\n###### 4. Strengthen Transparency and Stakeholder Communication\n\n* Prepare for potential **federal baselines on AI reporting and disclosures,** including where AI materially influences customer outcomes or core operations.\n* Integrate AI into **enterprise risk management and board reporting,** focusing on how AI both enables growth and introduces new categories of risk.\n* Consider an AI Risk Diagnostic\n\nAon\u2019s Thought Leaders\n\n* Jesus Gonzalez\n\n  Intangible Assets Global Collaboration Co-Leader\n* Daniel Serota\n\n  Vice President of Government and Public Affairs\n\n1 \"Guardrails and Growth: AI\u2019s Role in Capital and Insurance Markets,\" Before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment (Jul 30, 2025), <https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/kalinich_testimony_7-30-25.pdf>   \n   \n 2 Texas Responsible Artificial Intelligence Governance Act (TRAIGA) (HB 149) was signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott.1 TRAIGA takes effect on 1 January 2026   \n   \n 3 \"Governor Ron DeSantis Announces Proposal for Citizen Bill of Rights for Artificial Intelligence\" (Dec 4, 2025), <https://www.flgov.com/eog/news/press/2025/governor-ron-desantis-announces-proposal-citizen-bill-rights-artificial>   \n   \n 4 Implementation of NAIC Model Bulletin: Use of Artificial Intelligence Systems by Insurers, National Association of Insurance Commissioners (last updated Aug. 5, 2025), <https://content.naic.org/sites/default/files/cmte-h-big-data-artificial-intelligence-wg-map-ai-model-bulletin.pdf>.   \n   \n 5 US State-by-State AI Legislation Snapshot, Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP (Dec. 16, 2025), <https://www.bclplaw.com/en-US/events-insights-news/us-state-by-state-artificial-intelligence-legislation-snapshot.html>  \n   \n 6 \"Implications of Artificial Intelligence Technologies on Protecting Consumers from Unwanted Robocalls and Robotexts,\" (Aug 8, 2024), <https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-84A1.pdf>  \n   \n 7 Prepared and issued by Mark D Gray, Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer, \"FTC Compliance Plan on Advancing Governance, Innovation, and Risk Management for Agency Use of Artificial Intelligence,\" (Sept 2025), <https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/FTC-AI-Use-Policy.pdf>   \n   \n 8 \"Commerce Department Launches New Center to Guide AI Standards and Security,\" (Jun 2025), [https://www.asme.org/government-relations/policy-impact/commerce-department-launches-new-center-to-guide-ai-standards-and-security](https://www.asme.org/government-relations/policy-impact/commerce-department-launches-new-center-to-guide-ai-standards-and-security )  \n   \n 9 Tracking the Evolution of AI Insurance Regulation | Fenwick, by Heidi Lawson, Faye Wang, Sarah Hopkins (Dec 11, 2025), <https://www.fenwick.com/insights/publications/tracking-the-evolution-of-ai-insurance-regulation>\n\nGeneral Disclaimer\n\nThis document is not intended to address any specific situation or to provide legal, regulatory, financial, or other advice.

The Framework acknowledges that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is \u201ca new area of human development\u201d that \u201cpresents significant opportunities to the world while posing various risks and challenges.\u201d Aimed at addressing the safety, ethics, and social implications of AI, the Framework is designed around a \u201cpeople-centered approach\u201d and the \u201cprinciple of developing AI for good.\u201d\n\nThe Framework outlines principles for AI safety governance, classifies anticipated risks related to AI, identifies technological measures to mitigate those risks, and provides governance measures and safety guidelines. Our alert provides a detailed summary of the Framework.\n\n**Principles and framework for AI safety governance**\n\nThe Framework prioritizes addressing ethical concerns in AI development, including safety, transparency, and accountability, and seeks to develop AI in ways that are inclusive and equitable, avoiding biased or discriminatory outcomes. It outlines control measures to address different types of AI safety risk through technological and managerial strategies, emphasizing the importance of continuously updating control measures and refining the governance framework.\n\nSome of the identified principles include:\n\n* Prioritizing the innovative development of AI\n* Establishing governance mechanisms that engage all stakeholders, ensuring coordinating efforts and collaboration\n* Creating a whole process, including all elements of the governance chain\n* Fostering safe, reliable, equitable, and transparent AI, and\n* Protecting the rights and interests of citizens and organizations such that AI technology benefits humanity.\n\nThe Framework indicates that those principles will be best served by:\n\n* Taking an innovative and inclusive approach to ensure safety in AI research, development, and application\n* Identifying and mitigating risks with agile governance\n* Integrating technology and management to prevent and address safety risks throughout AI research, development, and application, and\n* Promoting openness and cooperation on AI safety governance, with the best practices shared worldwide.\n\n**Classification of AI safety risks**\n\nThe Framework places a concentrated focus on proactively identifying AI safety risks through the technology\u2019s development, deployment, and application, and mandating continuous monitoring to spot emerging risks and quickly mitigate them. The Framework classifies AI safety risks into two overarching categories: inherent risks from the technology itself, and risks posed by its application. The types of risk identified by the Framework are depicted in the table below.\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Safety risks** | | |  |  |\n| Inherent safety risks | Risks from models and algorithms | Risks of explainability |  |  |\n| Risks of bias and discrimination |  |  |\n| Risks of robustness |  |  |\n| Risks of stealing and tampering |  |  |\n| Risks of unreliable output |  |  |\n| Risks of adversarial attack |  |  |\n| Risks from data | Risks of illegal collection and use of data |  |  |\n| Risks of improper content and poisoning in training data |  |  |\n| Risks of unregulated training data annotation |  |  |\n| Risks of data leakage |  |  |\n| Risks from AI systems | Risks of exploitation through defects and backdoors |  |  |\n| Risks of computing infrastructure security |  |  |\n| Risks of supply chain security |  |  |\n| Safety risks in AI applications | Cyberspace risks | Risks of information and content safety |  |  |\n| Risks of confusing facts, misleading users and bypassing authentication |  |  |\n| Risks of information leakage due to improper usage |  |  |\n| Risks of abuse for cyberattacks |  |  |\n| Risks of security flaw transmission caused by model reuse |  |  |\n|  |  |\n| Real-world risks | Inducing traditional economic and social security risks |  |  |\n| Risks of using AI in illegal and criminal activities |  |  |\n| Risks of misuse of dual-use items and technologies |  |  |\n| Cognitive | Risks of amplifying the effects of \"information cocoons\" |  |  |\n| Risks of usage in launching cognitive warfare |  |  |\n| Ethical Risks | Risks of exacerbating social discrimination and prejudice, and widening the intelligence divide |  |  |\n| Risks of challenging traditional social order |  |  |\n| Risks of AI becoming uncontrollable in the future |  |  |\n\nUnlike the EU AI Act, which divides AI systems into four different risk levels (unacceptable, high, limited, and minimal) and provides level-specific regulatory requirements, the Framework only categorizes the AI safety risks (*ie*, identifying the areas where AI systems could trigger risks) and not the level of risks (*ie*, the negative impact or consequences that could be caused by AI systems).\n\nNevertheless, the EU AI Act model for risk level-based regulation is briefly mentioned in the Framework as a proposal for future regulations. This proposal indicates that only the AI systems with computing and reasoning capacities reaching (to be) prescribed thresholds or applied in (to be) prescribed industries and sectors need to be assessed and approved by the Chinese authorities before being put into the market. This is different from the current regulatory approach, which requires all AI systems to be assessed and approved and thus (strictly speaking) makes all overseas-hosted AI systems illegal and subject to the risk of being blocked in China.\n\n**Technological measures to address risks**\n\nThe Framework calls for AI developers, service providers, and system users to take technological measures to address the associated risks as identified above, and proposes technical countermeasures to improve safety, fairness, reliability, and robustness of AI. These measures focus on things like enhancing development practices, improving data quality, and conducting more rigorous evaluation to ensure that AI systems are performing reliably and safely. The technological measures generally track to the identified risks, seeking to propose techniques for risk mitigation for each of the identified categories of risk. The Framework provides a chart that links the risks to the proposed mitigations.\n\nIn particular, with regard to training data, the Framework emphasizes that sensitive data in high-risk fields such as nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and missiles must not be used in the training. When using personal data and \u201cimportant data\u201d (which refers to data that may affect national security or public interests and that will be prescribed in catalogues formulated by sector regulators), all existing privacy and data protection laws must be complied with.\n\nConsidering that the Chinese data protection law is mainly consent-based, requires the disclosure of processing details (*eg*, data categories, processing purposes, and third parties involved) on an exhaustive basis, and imposes strong restrictions on cross-border data transfers, ensuring training data compliance can be an extremely challenging task for developers. Moreover, many industrials and production data may constitute \u201cimportant data\u201d and thus must not leave China without government approval. To use such data to train algorithms, developers would have to move the servers exclusively within China.\n\n**Comprehensive governance measures**\n\nIn addition to technological controls, the Framework emphasizes the need for adaptive control measures, recognizing that, as AI technologies evolve, so must its governance mechanisms. The Framework makes clear that comprehensive governance measures rely on multiple stakeholders (*eg*, technology R&D institutions, service providers, users, government authorities, industry associations, and social organizations) to identify, prevent, and respond to risks.\n\nAccording to the Framework, comprehensive governance mechanisms and regulations should:\n\n* Implement a tiered and category-based management for AI application based on AI risk level classification, with higher risk use cases requiring enhanced control and oversight\n* Develop a traceability management system for AI services\n* Improve data security and personal information protection regulations in various stages such as AI training, labeling, utilization, and output\n* Create a responsible AI R&D and application system by proposing instructions and best practices that uphold the people-centered approach and adhere to the principle of developing AI for good, which includes establishing ethical standards, norms, and guidelines to improve the ethical review system\n* Strengthen AI supply chain security by promoting knowledge sharing in AI\n* Advance research on AI explainability, transparency, and trustworthiness\n* Track and analyze security vulnerabilities, defects, risk, threats, and safety incidents related to AI, and establish emergency response mechanisms for such incidents to ensure rapid and effective response\n* Enhance and promote AI safety education and training, and\n* Establish and improve mechanisms for AI safety education, industry self-regulation, and social supervision.\n\nWhile the Framework is focused on China, it emphasizes the need to align AI governance with global norms and standards. According to the Framework, cross-border collaboration is necessary for addressing global challenges like cybersecurity, ethical usage, and safety.\n\n**Safety guidelines for AI development and application**\n\nThe Framework further outlines safety guidelines for the development and application of AI that are specific to developers, service providers, and types of users. Individuals along the value chain are expected to comply with regulatory requirements, including developing mechanisms for regular compliance checks, audits, and reviews. In addition to these high-level themes across the value chain, individuals are also provided role-specific guidelines.\n\nAccording to the Framework:\n\n* Developers should adhere to ethics, strengthen data security and protection, guarantee the security of training environments, assess potential biases, evaluate readiness of products and services, regularly conduct safety and security evaluations, and generate and analyze testing reports.\n* Service providers should publicize information and disclosures related to their AI use, obtain user consent, establish and improve real-time risk monitoring and management systems, report safety and security incidents and vulnerabilities, and assess the impact of AI products on users.\n* Users in key areas (including government departments, critical information infrastructure, and areas directly affecting public safety and people\u2019s health and safety) should assess impacts of applying AI technology, conduct risk assessments, regularly perform system audits, fully understand data processing and privacy protection measures, enhance network and supply chain security, limit data access, and avoid complete reliance on AI for decision making without human intervention.\n* General users should raise their awareness of potential safety risks associated with AI, carefully review all terms of service, enhance awareness of personal information protection, become informed about data processing practices and cybersecurity risks, and be aware of the potential impact of AI products on minors.\n\nAs a key policy and cultural consideration reflected in many of the mechanisms mentioned above, AI developers and service providers are encouraged to monitor and screen both the training data and the outputs generated by AI systems, and put in place effective control measures to prevent information that is inconsistent with China\u2019s core ideology of socialism, or that has public opinion manipulation or negative social mobilization capabilities, from being processed in the AI systems. Put simply, companies are encouraged to comply with China content monitoring regulations.\n\n**Takeaways**\n\nLike other international regulations, the Framework takes a risk-based approach to AI governance and ties the risk level to specific mitigations \u2013 both technological and governance-based. It also stresses the need for ongoing assessments of AI systems to ensure they meet safety standards and do not pose unintended risks. The Framework is part of China\u2019s stated goal to be a global leader in AI by 2030, and purports to reflect a balancing act between the desire for innovation with the need for regulating the development and use of AI that is safe and ethical.\n\n**DLA Piper is here to help**\n\nDLA Piper\u2019s team of lawyers and data scientists assist organizations in navigating the complex workings of their AI systems to ensure compliance with current and developing regulatory requirements.

China, the EU, and the U.S. each take distinct approaches to harness AI\u2019s potential while mitigating its risks. At the same time, [AI ethics principles](https://pernot-leplay.com/ai-ethics-principles/) have emerged worldwide, revealing both common ground and notable differences across legal and ethical frameworks. This article examines how major jurisdictions regulate AI, the varied directions they take, and the underlying rationales driving their approaches.**\n\nUnlike in the realm of data privacy, the EU may not be the sole standard-setter for AI regulation to find the right balance for the AI dilemma. China and the U.S. are also competing for leadership, with each jurisdiction beginning its regulatory efforts at around the same time. Although this race to regulate artificial intelligence began before ChatGPT, the rise of generative AI has significantly accelerated global efforts. The divergence and debates in this AI race echo the varied approaches seen in data privacy regulation, as each jurisdiction pursues its own path based on national priorities and values.\n\n## Full policy article just published!\n\nThis blog post is a lighter version of the full **peer-reviewed article** published in the **Georgetown Journal of International Affairs, Summer 2025**.\n\n[Go to complete article](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5368093)\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n* [The AI Dilemma: AI Regulation in China, EU & the U.S.](#toc_The_AI_Dilemma_AI_Regulation_in_China_EU)\n* [Full policy article just published!](#toc_Full_policy_article_just_published)\n* [What is the AI Dilemma?](#toc_What_is_the_AI_Dilemma)\n* [The EU AI Act: A Risk-Based, Comprehensive Approach](#toc_The_EU_AI_Act_A_RiskBased_Comprehensive_Approach)\n* [The U.S.: Guidelines and Narrow Bills](#toc_The_US_Guidelines_and_Narrow_Bills)\n* [China AI Regulation: Balancing Development and State control](#toc_Chinas_AI_Law_Balancing_Development_and_State_control)\n  + [China\u2019s Agile Approach to Regulating AI](#toc_Chinas_Agile_Approach_to_Regulating_AI)\n  + [China AI Laws Favoring AI Adoption](#toc_China_AI_Laws_Favoring_AI_Adoption)\n  + [Determination to Maintain State Control](#toc_Determination_to_Maintain_State_Control)\n* [Who will solve the AI Dilemma in Regulation?](#toc_Who_will_solve_the_Global_AI_Regulation_Dilemma)\n\n## *Executive Summary: Diverse Solutions to the AI Dilemma*\n\n*This article provides a comprehensive comparison of the AI regulatory approaches taken by China, the EU, and the U.S. to solve the AI dilemma. Each shaped by unique national goals, values, and socio-political factors. While the EU\u2019s AI Act seeks to set a global standard by focusing on risk-based safeguards for fundamental rights, it may struggle to keep up with AI\u2019s rapid evolution. The U.S. adopts a flexible, sector-specific approach that promotes innovation, though it risks losing influence due to its lack of a centralized framework. China, meanwhile, balances agile regulation with state control, rapidly adapting its policies to support AI adoption while aligning AI development with government objectives. As global powers grapple with AI\u2019s societal risks and potential, the race to establish international norms to solve the AI dilemma is still wide open.*\n\n## What is the AI Dilemma?\n\n**The AI dilemma centers on balancing safety with innovation**. On the one hand, stringent AI laws can stifle innovation; on the other, unchecked innovation can pose risks to society and individuals.\n\nEach jurisdiction may approach this balance differently, guided by broader national goals, cultural norms, and socio-political contexts. This diversity reflects unique national priorities around issues such as privacy, security, economic competitiveness, and technological leadership.\n\nUltimately, addressing the AI dilemma in regulation requires each country to find an optimal path that fosters technological advancement and its benefits while safeguarding against potential risks and aligning with the nation\u2019s values and objectives.\n\n## The EU AI Act: A Risk-Based, Comprehensive Approach\n\nWith the AI Act, **the EU aims to establish a global benchmark for AI regulation**, similar to how the GDPR set standards for data privacy. Like the GDPR, the AI Act is a regulation \u2013 meaning it will be directly applicable across all EU Member States without requiring national legislation.\n\nThe AI Act **categorizes AI systems based on their risk** to society, with each category triggering different compliance requirements. Certain AI systems, such as social scoring and live facial recognition in public spaces, are outright **prohibited**. High-risk systems \u2013 often used in HR or law enforcement \u2013 bear the majority of the regulatory burden, particularly for providers of these AI solutions. These systems will need to undergo Fundamental Rights Impact Assessments, similar to the GDPR\u2019s Data Protection Impact Assessments, reflecting the EU\u2019s emphasis on protecting fundamental rights, including data privacy.\n\nThe EU AI Act also includes transparency requirements for AI systems that end-users might mistake for non-AI content, such as chatbots or other AI-generated information. Foundation models, like ChatGPT, are subject to additional regulations, particularly around transparency. Providers must disclose details about these models\u2019 functioning, design, and guidelines for safe integration into organizational solutions. Finally, AI systems outside of these specified categories \u2013 such as spam filters and video games \u2013 are not in the scope of the EU AI Act.\n\nThe EU\u2019s approach with the AI Act is intentionally broad, aiming to cover all sectors much like the GDPR. By being early to establish a comprehensive framework, the EU hopes the Act will serve as a global model, influencing practices worldwide\u2014even though its formal scope is the EU internal market. The Act\u2019s risk-based approach requires companies to identify and mitigate AI-related risks proactively. While the AI Act doesn\u2019t directly grant individual rights as the GDPR does, its ultimate goal is to protect fundamental rights, a core driver that distinguishes the EU\u2019s approach from those of China and the U.S.\n\nThe EU has prioritized swift action on AI regulation, a point that European Commissioner Thierry Breton has proudly emphasized. A key ambition of the AI Act is to set a global standard for AI regulation.\n\n## The U.S.: Guidelines and Narrow Bills\n\nThe U.S. approach to AI regulation is more piecemeal and sector-specific, with a strong emphasis on voluntary compliance \u2013 quite different from the EU\u2019s comprehensive strategy. The underlying **rationale is that AI technology still needs space to grow and develop** before sweeping, binding regulations are put in place. Both government and private organizations have published various AI ethical principles and guidelines, and there are bills proposed at both federal and state levels. However, nothing as broad or centralized as the EU AI Act is currently on the horizon. This lightweight, sectoral approach is similar to the U.S. stance on data privacy regulation.\n\nAt the **federal** level, the [U.S. Executive Order on AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/) has garnered significant attention. Issued by President Biden, it aims to promote ethical, safe, and trustworthy AI development, focusing on American values such as privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. The order provides guidelines for federal agencies, balancing the need for AI innovation with responsible usage to align with public interest and national values across both government and private sectors. While not legally binding, it broadly directs agencies to procure and operate only responsible AI systems, and it places transparency and accountability requirements on companies developing these systems. The order also includes an express call for Congress to pass bipartisan legislation on AI and privacy. However, questions remain about how the order [will be enforced](https://time.com/6330652/biden-ai-order/).\n\nSeveral bills are also being considered, most on a relatively narrow scope. At the federal level, a [growing number of proposals](https://time.com/6328332/federal-ai-regulation-schumer-forum/) arrive, one of the latest would require AI companies to [disclose copyrighted training data](https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/22/24012757/ai-foundation-model-transparency-act-bill-copyright-regulation). At the **state** level, one in California proposes rules for [automated decision-making technology.](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/california-signals-intent-to-regulate-9459603/) Florida may strengthen transparency over [AI-generated content for political ads](https://www.tampabay.com/news/florida-politics/2023/12/20/artificial-intelligence-ai-political-ads-regulation-technology/).\n\n**California\u2019s recent AI bill** (SB 1047) offered a new perspective on the U.S. approach, emphasizing stringent safety standards specifically for high-cost AI models. However, Governor Newsom vetoed it in September 2024, citing its potential to stifle innovation and advocating instead for a balanced, risk-based regulation model similar to the EU\u2019s approach. This development underscores the evolving debate within the U.S. on regulating AI without hindering its progress. For further details on California\u2019s AI bill SB 1047, see my comments [here](https://pernot-leplay.com/california-ai-bill-sb1047-safety-innovation/).\n\nThe risk of the U.S.\u2019s wait-and-see approach is that it may diminish its influence in the global regulatory debate. U.S. laws \u2013 and company practices \u2013 may ultimately be shaped by the so-called \u201cBrussels Effect,\u201d where companies adapt to comply with the EU AI Act, which will, in effect, set the standard for many U.S. requirements as well.\n\n## China AI Regulation: Balancing Development and State control\n\nAgainst this backdrop, China does support its AI sector through various policy tools (see below). One could say this support is part of a broader Chinese policy encouraging domestic development and Chinese actors. We can see it in China\u2019s broader legal framework on tech, such as [China data privacy law](https://pernot-leplay.com/data-privacy-law-china-comparison-europe-usa/) or the [restrictions on cross-border data transfers in PIPL](https://pernot-leplay.com/pipl-data-transfer-china/). Of course, the law is one of the country\u2019s policy tools to support its objective of global AI dominance.\n\nThe Chinese government has set a clear objective: to make China the [global AI leader by 2030](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357737833_Future_China_AI_Leader_in_2030). In this race for AI dominance, China\u2019s [primary competitor is the U.S.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-09/us-will-lead-china-on-ai-for-years-deepmind-co-founder-says), and the competition extends beyond [research output](https://hbr.org/2021/02/is-china-emerging-as-the-global-leader-in-ai) to include [export restrictions](https://time.com/6324619/us-biden-ai-chips-china/) and [espionage](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/china-is-stealing-ai-secrets-to-turbocharge-spying-u-s-says-00413594) concerns, both critical to national security.\n\nTo advance its AI sector, China uses a range of policy tools that align with its broader strategy to promote domestic growth and strengthen Chinese tech companies. This approach is reflected in China\u2019s broader legal framework for technology, including its data privacy laws and the cross-border data transfer restrictions in the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL). Legislation is thus one of China\u2019s strategic levers in its pursuit of global AI leadership.\n\nIn the remainder of this article, I\u2019ll illustrate how China\u2019s AI regulation aligns with this overarching goal.\n\nChina has positioned itself as an early mover in AI regulation, a contrast to its approach in data privacy, where it largely follows the EU\u2019s model (particularly regarding consumer privacy, rather than citizen privacy). With AI law, however, China is staking out its own approach, stepping in early while the EU and the U.S. are still shaping their frameworks.\n\n### China\u2019s Agile Approach to Regulating AI\n\nChina has adopted an agile approach to AI regulation, swiftly enacting policies on specific areas as they emerge. Typically, regulations are initially published as drafts, with amendments made following discussions with private sector stakeholders and academia. A notable example of this iterative process is China\u2019s rules on generative AI, which were first proposed in April 2023 and [finalized](https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/generative-ai-interim/) by August 2023.\n\nThis agile method offers both advantages and drawbacks. On the plus side, China\u2019s AI legal framework is able to adapt quickly to new technologies, like generative AI. In contrast, Europe\u2019s response to the sudden rise of ChatGPT required the AI Act drafters to hurriedly incorporate new provisions, which [nearly derailed negotiations](https://www.techpolicy.press/will-disagreement-over-foundation-models-put-the-eu-ai-act-at-risk/). However, the rapid, evolving nature of China\u2019s AI laws means they are not yet fully stabilized, creating gray areas for companies navigating compliance. Additionally, the lack of clarity on enforcement mechanisms adds a layer of uncertainty for businesses operating under these emerging regulations.\n\n### China AI Laws Favoring AI Adoption\n\nFeedback on the April draft led to a [softening](https://thediplomat.com/2023/08/chinas-censors-back-down-on-generative-ai/) of several requirements, creating a more favorable regulatory environment for AI companies. For instance, what was initially a strict obligation to ensure outputs were accurate was revised to a \u201cbest effort\u201d standard. Additional AI regulations address [algorithmic recommendations](https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-internet-information-service-algorithmic-recommendation-management-provisions-effective-march-1-2022/) and [deep synthesis](https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/deep-synthesis/).\n\nHigh-level government directives also shape a legal landscape that supports AI adoption. In November 2023, a Beijing court ruled that AI-generated content could be [eligible for copyright protection](https://www.engage.hoganlovells.com/knowledgeservices/news/beijing-internet-court-grants-copyright-protection-for-ai-artworks-but-copyrightability-debate-of-ai-generated-output-continues) \u2013 a stark contrast to the U.S., where similar claims have been dismissed, and the EU, where the AI Act\u2019s [copyright provisions](https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-lawmakers-committee-reaches-deal-artificial-intelligence-act-2023-04-27/) may present challenges for AI developers. Although this ruling came from a lower-level court, it signals a supportive stance toward AI in China. However, this approach may also raise questions, such as whether it could stifle human creativity, which AI still relies on to some extent. Overall, China\u2019s regulatory approach underscores its commitment to promoting AI adoption and development.\n\n### Determination to Maintain State Control\n\nA defining feature of China\u2019s AI regulation is the emphasis on maintaining state control, which can sometimes clash with the goal of fostering rapid AI adoption. This need for control was recently [reaffirmed by Xi Jinping](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/01/chinas-xi-jinping-calls-for-greater-state-control-of-ai-to-counter-dangerous-storms), underscoring the importance of ensuring AI development aligns with the \u201ccorrect political direction.\u201d While certain regulatory requirements have been softened to support AI growth, these political obligations remain firmly in place, particularly for public-facing AI systems. This framework allows room for [censorship](https://pernot-leplay.com/political-censorship-china-biggest-ai-obstacle/) and selective enforcement, distinguishing China\u2019s approach from the EU and U.S., where respect for individual rights and democratic values is embedded in both emerging laws and [ethical guidelines for AI](https://pernot-leplay.com/ai-ethics-principles/).\n\nState control over AI development in China also extends beyond legislation. Through significant public investment, including [state-backed venture capital funds](https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/chinese-public-ai-rd-spending-provisional-findings/), the government influences AI companies\u2019 development priorities, guiding them toward alignment with national objectives.\n\n## Who will solve the AI Dilemma in Regulation?\n\nIn this article, we explored the three distinct approaches that China, the EU, and the U.S. have taken toward AI law. Yet, it\u2019s too early to determine who, if anyone, will ultimately set the global standard. If we look to privacy law for comparison, the EU has led the way, with GDPR now widely regarded as the global model for data privacy legislation. So far, however, no equivalent exists for AI regulation.\n\n**The EU aims for the AI Act to be an overarching framework, classifying and regulating AI systems according to their societal risks**. At its core is the protection of fundamental rights. However, the challenge for the EU lies in its regulatory agility: AI technology evolves rapidly, as demonstrated by generative AI like ChatGPT, which emerged after the AI Act was proposed in 2021 and required substantial amendments to the draft.\n\n**The U.S., by contrast, favors guidelines and sector-specific bills to promote AI safety while leaving room for innovation**. With no comprehensive federal privacy law yet in place, many aspects of AI regulation remain unaddressed. This wait-and-see approach allows flexibility but also risks sidelining the U.S. in the global debate, lacking a cohesive framework to offer as an international model.\n\n**China\u2019s approach may be the most agile, adopting targeted policies to address specific AI issues and enacting laws quickly**. This responsiveness enables China to react to new AI developments and could position it as a model for international AI laws. However, the potential lack of stability in its regulatory framework may create uncertainty for companies, leading to gray areas that could hinder development and investment.\n\nThese jurisdictions have each taken a unique stance in navigating the AI dilemma, but in 2024, the landscape remains fluid and evolving. In future analyses, I will delve deeper into their rationales and the potential paths forward. For now, it\u2019s clear that establishing global standards in AI regulation may prove far more challenging than it was for data privacy.\n\n##### AI & Data Privacy Compliance\n\nIn this blog you'll find my articles about AI and privacy regulations from the EU, the US and China.\n\n***Interested in Digital Geopolitcs?*** **Subscribe to my Newsletter:**\n\n**Comparative Studies (US, EU, China): [AI Regulation](https://pernot-leplay.com/ai-regulation-china-eu-us-comparison/) \u2013 [AI Ethics](https://pernot-leplay.com/ai-ethics-principles/) \u2013\u00a0 [Privacy Regulation](https://pernot-leplay.com/data-privacy-law-china-comparison-europe-usa/)**\n\n[About](https://pernot-leplay.com/about/) \u2013 [Blog](https://pernot-leplay.com/blog/) \u2013 [Contact](https://pernot-leplay.com/contact/)\n\n\u00a9 2026 \u2022 Pernot-Leplay.com \u2022 All Rights Reserved\n\n[Page load link](#)\n\n### Subscribe to *Digital Geopolitics*\n\nOnce a week, get sharp insights on how AI, data, and tech regulation are reshaping global power in China, the US, and Europe.\n\n[Go to Top](#)\n\n ",

This review focuses on the clinical impact of mRNA-based treatments and their transformative potential in modern medicine. mRNA therapeutics utilize the host's cellular machinery to produce target proteins, enabling highly specific and customizable treatments. In the case of cancer, mRNA vaccines to stimulate immune responses against such tumor-specific antigens are being developed in a personalized manner. Infectious diseases are also an indication for which mRNA vaccines have shown a significant effect on preventing viral infection, as the global success of mRNA COVID vaccines demonstrates. Among genetic disorders, mRNA therapy presents a new way to restore defective proteins and reverse the underlying pattern of genetic defects. Furthermore, mRNA treatment of autoimmune diseases aims to generate immune tolerance and avoid traditional immunosuppressive therapy. Advances are being driven by the discovery of new technologies to stabilize, deliver, and modulate the immune system around mRNAs. Recent advances in delivery systems and RNA stabilization have further expanded the potential of mRNA vaccines for viral diseases. mRNA therapeutics have the advantage of being rapidly developed and adaptable to a wide range. Research on\u00a0further improvement of the delivery mechanisms and long-term safety will be necessary for extending the clinical applications of mRNA therapeutics.\n\n**Keywords:** autoimmune diseases, cancer immunotherapy, covid-19, genetic disorders, mrna therapeutics\n\n## Introduction and background\n\nBackground of mRNA vaccines\n\nThe origins of mRNA vaccines lie in the 1990s when researchers in search of more innovative approaches to combating disease turned to gene vaccines. Early exploration of mRNA technology faced challenges due to the molecule's instability. However, by the early 2000s, significant advancements were made, most notably the development of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which protect mRNA from degradation and facilitate its delivery into cells. These innovations laid the foundation for the success of mRNA vaccines [[1](#REF1)], particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSuccessful mRNA vaccines for COVID-19\n\nAs the first time mRNA vaccines were rolled out collectively, Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273) were among the first to be given Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) recognition by agencies like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Extensive phase 3 trials [[2](#REF2),[3](#REF3)] showed that each vaccine had more than 90% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infection.\n\nFigure [1](#FIG1) illustrates the fundamental process by which genetic information is expressed within cells. DNA, the hereditary material, is transcribed into\u00a0mRNA, which serves as a temporary copy of the gene. The mRNA then undergoes translation by the cellular machinery to synthesize specific proteins. These proteins perform essential structural and functional roles in the cell and are the basis of many mRNA-based therapeutic strategies.\n\nOverview of the importance of mRNA vaccines in public health\n\nThe swift development of mRNA vaccines in the COVID-19 pandemic has shown their capability to tackle emerging infectious disease threats. In contrast to conventional vaccine approaches that tend to take years to shift from design to production, mRNA platforms permit more rapid initial development. But these benefits need to be recognized as being subject to logistical and regulatory hurdles such as cold-chain storage needs, scalability of manufacture, and requiring efficient approval mechanisms [[4](#REF4)]. In addition, mRNA vaccines have been found to have a favorable safety profile and provide flexibility to adjust to mutating viral strains [[5](#REF5)].\n\nPurpose of the review\n\nThe purpose of this review is to explore the potential of mRNA vaccines beyond COVID-19. It aims to examine emerging research, applications, and possible advancements in the field of mRNA vaccine technology, including its use for cancer, autoimmune diseases, and other infectious diseases.\n\n## Review\n\nMechanism of action: how mRNA vaccines work\n\nFundamentals of mRNA Technology\n\nBasic Principles of mRNA Vaccine Function:\u00a0The mechanism behind Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines is to take advantage of a synthetic mRNA sequence encoding a viral antigen to cue human cells into producing a protein related to the virus, thus triggering an immune response. This method reflects an essential deviation from typical vaccinations that usually depend on either live attenuated or inactivated viral forms to stimulate protective immunity. After the delivery of mRNA, it goes into the cells where ribosomes interpret the mRNA sequence into a viral protein, commonly the spike protein for the SARS-CoV-2 virus in vaccines aimed at COVID-19, including those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.\u00a0The translated protein is non-infectious but serves as an immunogen that activates the adaptive immune system. The antigen is recognized as foreign by the immune system, leading to activation of B-cells and T-cells that mediate both humoral and cellular immunity. These immune responses get the body ready to quickly respond to the actual virus if it is encountered in the future [[6](#REF6)].\n\nEvaluation of Traditional Vaccine Technologies in Comparison:\u00a0Traditional vaccines typically fall into two main categories: vaccines that are live attenuated and vaccines that are inactivated. Live attenuated vaccines contain a virus able to multiply in the body, but it does not trigger sickness. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is a single illustration, along with the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine. Unlike live virus vaccines, on the contrary, inactivated vaccines include completely inactivated virus particles that cannot multiply inside the body. The polio vaccine, along with the hepatitis A vaccine, serves as an example.\n\nFigure [2](#FIG2) shows how mRNA vaccines function against SARS-CoV-2. The mRNA is introduced into antigen-presenting cells (APCs), where it gets translated into the viral spike protein. The expressed protein is subsequently processed and presented through major histocompatibility complex (MHC) pathways: peptides are loaded onto MHC class I molecules, which stimulates CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, whereas presentation through MHC class II molecules stimulates CD4+ helper T cells. This dual pathway activates both cellular and humoral immune responses. In particular, B cells are activated to generate neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein and prevent its interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on host cells to block viral entry. These immune mechanisms act synergistically to clear infected cells and provide immunity against future infection [[7](#REF7)].\n\nWhere traditional vaccines have shown promise, they also come with obstacles like longer development periods, the obligation for laboratory pathogen culturing, and possible risks for those with immune system disorders, when live attenuated vaccines are on hand. In opposition, mRNA vaccines can be rapidly synthesized in a laboratory, do not involve the handling of live viruses, and are likely safer for a broader population due to their exact targeted action [[8](#REF8)].\n\nImmunological response triggered by mRNA vaccines\n\nThe Role of mRNA in Protein Synthesis and Immune Activation\n\nWhen a vaccine's mRNA enters cells, it does not fuse with the host's DNA but remains in the cytoplasm, where it is translated into protein by the cell\u2019s ribosomes. For example, the mRNA used in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines encodes the spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is recognized by the immune system as a foreign antigen. Once synthesized, the spike protein is processed and presented on the cell surface via MHC\u00a0molecules, making it detectable to immune cells.\u00a0In the humoral response, B-cells are activated to produce antibodies that neutralize the spike protein, thereby preventing the virus from infecting host cells during future encounters. This mechanism is central to vaccine-mediated protection and can be rapidly adapted for other viral pathogens. Concurrently, the cellular response involves T-cells, particularly cytotoxic T-cells, which recognize and eliminate cells displaying the spike protein, thereby assisting in infection clearance and contributing to long-term immunity.\n\nFigure [3](#FIG3) conveys that this dual response is important for achieving effective protection against viruses, and mRNA vaccines are especially effective in stimulating these responses because of the strong antigen expression they generate [[9](#REF9)].\n\nThe Relationship Between Safety Profile and Immune System Interaction\n\nThe principal anxiety related to all new vaccine technologies is their safety. mRNA vaccines have shown an encouraging safety profile as they lack live elements and cannot modify the host\u2019s genetic makeup. The mRNA breaks down by itself in the body within a few days of injection, which lowers the chance of enduring side effects. The mRNA vaccines designed for COVID-19 showed mild to moderate side effects closely related to vaccines during clinical trials, including shot site pain, exhaustion, headache, and a mild spike in temperature. Rare serious effects, including anaphylaxis, have happened at a rate of about two to five cases per million doses given [[10](#REF10)]. These responses are largely because of the lipid nanoparticles used for mRNA delivery, not the mRNA itself.\n\nIn addition, mRNA vaccines are devoid of infectivity and do not utilize any infectious agent, thereby diminishing the chance of both causing the disease they are designed to protect against, a potential problem with live attenuated vaccines. The other contribution of mRNA is that it permits the fast tailoring of vaccines to newly emerging variants, an ability that will be fundamental for addressing future pandemics and new viruses [[11](#REF11)]. Delivering rapid development times, top efficacy, and an effective safety profile, mRNA vaccines constitute a landmark development in the field of vaccinology. Through its robust immune response stimulation via protein synthesis and its non-infectious properties, the technology establishes itself as a platform with great promise in preventing infectious diseases and also in therapeutic fields like cancer immunotherapy and chronic disease management. Although traditional vaccines have served us well, mRNA vaccines present a flexible and strong new resource for responding to both present and future public health challenges.\n\nBeyond COVID-19: emerging applications of mRNA vaccines\n\nCancer Vaccines\n\nCurrent Research on mRNA Vaccines for Personalized Cancer Immunotherapy: mRNA vaccines have demonstrated their ability to stimulate the immune system to go after and eliminate cancer cells in cancer immunotherapy.\n\nFigure [4](#FIG4) charts the current research focus and future horizons of mRNA vaccines in different medical areas, including cancer, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, and zoonotic diseases. The blue bars illustrate the fraction of current research investment in each area, and the green bars reflect the likely future potential for mRNA vaccines in these sectors. Importantly, infectious diseases are in the lead regarding both current research attention (60%) and future possibilities (80%). At present, autoimmune diseases and zoonotic diseases are not getting much attention, but they have a strong potential for future growth (50% and 45%, respectively).\n\nIn contrast to infectious disease vaccines, cancer vaccines require the targeting of antigens specific to the tumour. mRNA vaccines facilitate the provision of tailored antigens based on the special mutations present in a person's tumour (neoantigens). Melanoma, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer are the subjects of intense study for personalized cancer mRNA vaccines. This personalized strategy enables the immune system to distinguish tumor-specific neoantigens and mount a targeted cytotoxic response against malignant cells\u00a0[[12](#REF12)].\u00a0However, tumor heterogeneity, antigen escape, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment remain key obstacles to effective mRNA-based cancer immunotherapy [[8](#REF8)].\n\nExamples of Clinical Trials Currently Ongoing and Their Findings:\u00a0Important research into an mRNA cancer vaccine involves the melanoma vaccine developed by BioNTech, which has delivered promising results in its early clinical trials. The results from the phase I trial of BNT111, an mRNA cancer vaccine, showed a strong immune response in patients with advanced melanoma. Moderna's mRNA-4157 is another illustration that is now in clinical trials for individuals with solid tumours. Findings early in the studies indicate that when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, the vaccine could result in an improved outcome for patients [[13](#REF13)].\n\nChallenges and Opportunities in the Development of mRNA Cancer Vaccines:\u00a0The main challenges in developing mRNA cancer vaccines are to identify appropriate antigens for a variety of cancers and to ensure that the immune responses induced by the vaccine are directed against tumour cells. The challenges also include working in the immunosuppressive setting that tumours create. Nevertheless, this potential for opportunities is still translated in the virtue of the faculty of the mRNA technology to rapidly craft individualized vaccines and combine them with existing such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immune response durability and maintained efficacy are further to be analyzed [[14](#REF14)].\n\nInfluenza and Other Respiratory Viruses\n\nmRNA Vaccine Research for Influenza:\u00a0Traditional influenza vaccines use inactivated or live attenuated virus strains to create their products, but they need annual updates according to predicted circulating strains. The manufacturing process requires an extended time, while mismatches between vaccine strains and circulating viruses reduce its effectiveness. The development of influenza vaccines through mRNA technology provides a faster approach that allows better adaptation to vaccine production. The production process of mRNA vaccines for influenza takes less time, which reduces the chance of mismatch with circulating strains. Moderna and other drug manufacturers develop mRNA vaccines for influenza, which demonstrate promising findings during their initial preclinical investigations [[15](#REF15)].\n\nPotential for Addressing Other Respiratory Viruses:\u00a0Existing research indicates that mRNA vaccines could protect people from respiratory viruses, especially respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses, leading to major illness and death, mostly among young children and older adults. The research team at Moderna conducts clinical trials for RSV mRNA vaccines, which show promising results according to early laboratory findings [[16](#REF16)].\n\nZoonotic Diseases and Emerging Infections\n\nPotential Applications in Addressing Zoonotic Diseases:\u00a0Zoonotic diseases, which move from animals to humans, threaten worldwide health as these viruses have caused outbreaks of Zika and both Ebola and Nipah. Research on mRNA vaccines continues because they provide a fast reaction system for emerging infectious diseases, due to their straightforward development and adaptable nature. The preclinical testing of Zika virus mRNA vaccines proved successful because they created protective immune responses. Equally important to other mRNA vaccine developments are ongoing efforts to create vaccines against the Ebola virus and the Nipah virus, with an emphasis on enhanced outbreak response against conventional vaccine manufacturing processes [[17](#REF17)].\n\nOpportunities for mRNA Vaccines Regarding Diseases Including Zika, Ebola, and Nipah Viruses:\u00a0The World Health Organization has designated Zika virus, Ebola virus, and Nipah virus as the top priority diseases for vaccination. The quick design and manufacturing process of mRNA vaccines enables multiple benefits during outbreak situations. CureVac and Moderna have started research into mRNA vaccines for these viruses, obtaining encouraging\u00a0findings from preclinical and early-phase clinical trials. Research has demonstrated that mRNA-1893 from Moderna successfully creates protective immune responses in animal test subjects [[18](#REF18)].\n\nAutoimmune and Chronic Diseases\n\nExploration of mRNA Technology to Treat or Prevent Autoimmune Diseases:\u00a0Researchers conduct studies to determine mRNA vaccine potential for autoimmune disease protection and treatment, specifically for multiple sclerosis (MS) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The immune system's strength does not suffer from mRNA vaccines, unlike traditional treatments, because they offer the potential to control immune responses in a precise manner to minimize autoimmune damage without compromising holistic immune system operations. Findings from research conducted ahead of clinical trials reveal that mRNA vaccines can create tolerance toward self-antigens, which might stop the immune system from injuring the body\u2019s tissues, as occurs in autoimmune diseases [[19](#REF19)].\n\nFigure [5](#FIG5) highlights the assorted possible applications of mRNA technology in both treatments and vaccine development. This research highlights the ability of mRNA for use in self-amplifying vaccines, as well as in non-replicating vaccines, and in addressing a spectrum of diseases, including cancer, HIV, and heart failure. In addition, it mentions inventions such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) coding mRNA for treating genetic disorders such as refractory viral keratitis, mRNA-based immune cell therapy, and mRNA vaccines, including BNT162b2\u00a0and mRNA-1273 for influenza and COVID-19. Figure [5](#FIG5) thoroughly accents the comprehensive adaptability of mRNA for gene editing, immunotherapy, and the management of chronic diseases.\n\nChronic Disease Management and the Importance of Therapeutic mRNA Vaccines:\u00a0Alongside autoimmune diseases, researchers are investigating the application of mRNA technology for the management of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease. As an example, work is ongoing to develop mRNA therapies that guide the body to produce proteins that repair damaged heart tissue or promote regeneration in other tissues. Although mRNA-based therapeutics for chronic diseases are still in their infancy, the platform's flexibility and adaptability suggest a bright future for future treatments [[21](#REF21)].\n\nAdvantages and limitations of mRNA vaccines\n\nAdvantages\n\nRapid Development and Scalability:\u00a0A key advantage of mRNA vaccines is the speed at which they can be designed and manufactured in response to emerging pathogens. Other vaccines take months or years, if not decades, to grow live viruses or breed viral proteins. mRNA vaccines, in contrast, are developed in the lab by synthesizing an infectious disease virus's genetic material, enabling speedy design, testing, and manufacturing to address newly discovered infectious diseases. The potential for rapid vaccine production of the mRNA platform was especially exemplified by the COVID-19 pandemic when vaccines were engineered in a span of weeks, reflecting their ability to adapt and speed in times of pandemic response [[22](#REF22)]. Additionally, scalability is one of the strong points. Since mRNA is being produced synthetically, cell cultures or eggs that are often required in conventional vaccine manufacturing are not needed. This minimizes the risks of contamination and facilitates mass production within relatively short time frames. The capability of rapid expansion in production capacity helps mRNA vaccines respond to global needs, as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic [[23](#REF23)].\n\nHigh Efficacy and Safety Profile:\u00a0Clinical trial data prove that mRNA vaccines are very effective, especially for COVID-19 vaccination. Phase III trials revealed that the Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) and Moderna (mRNA-1273) vaccines were more than 90% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 [[24](#REF24)]. In addition to efficacy, mRNA vaccines elicit humoral and cellular immune responses, and thus they are a strong weapon against infectious diseases and cancers, and autoimmune disorders. From a safety point of view, mRNA vaccines preclude live viruses, thereby eliminating the risk of vaccine-derived infections associated with conventional live attenuated vaccines. Moreover, because mRNA does not get integrated into the host genome, mutagenesis risk is highly reduced [[25](#REF25)].\n\nFlexibility in Designing Vaccines for Different Pathogens:\u00a0mRNA vaccines are extremely versatile, making it possible to produce vaccines for nearly any pathogen by encoding a target protein of interest. Due to this flexibility, mRNA vaccines can rapidly respond to new strains or virus variants. During the COVID-19 pandemic, companies rapidly changed mRNA vaccines in response to newly emerged variants, illustrating the rapid adaptability of the technology and the possibility of using it for the long term for many infectious diseases [[26](#REF26)].\n\nPotential for Personalized Vaccines:\u00a0One more thrilling benefit of mRNA technology is its potential as personalized cancer vaccines. Tumors tend to have unique mutations, or neoantigens, that can be targeted with mRNA vaccines based on a patient's cancer signature. This means the immune system can identify and destroy cancer cells without harming normal tissue. Personalized mRNA cancer vaccines are in clinical trials today, with early results indicating this technology has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment [[27](#REF27)].\n\nLimitations\n\nStability Issues (Cold Chain Requirements for Storage):\u00a0The requirement for ultra-cold storage has limited equitable distribution in resource-limited regions. Innovations such as lyophilized (freeze-dried) formulations or thermostable LNPs are under active investigation to mitigate this barrier. The instability of mRNA and its propensity for degradation mean it must be stored extremely cold to function as designed. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine required storage at -70\u00b0C (-94\u00b0F) at the outset, while the Moderna vaccine needed to be stored at -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F). This creates major logistical problems, especially in countries with low and middle incomes, where the cold chain infrastructure is typically not sufficient [[28](#REF28)]. Ongoing analysis looks to create mRNA formulations that are more stable and can withstand higher storage temperatures.\n\nAdverse Reactions and Long-Term Safety Concerns:\u00a0In clinical trials, mRNA vaccines have demonstrated an encouraging safety record, although many side effects are generally mild to moderate (like injection site pain, fatigue, and headache), a small number of individuals have suffered serious reactions such as anaphylaxis. Although infrequent, these reactions suggest the need for thorough monitoring of adverse reactions that follow immunization [[29](#REF29)].\n\nAlso of concern is the deficiency of long-term safety data concerning mRNA vaccines. Since this technology is quite new, thorough studies over the long term are necessary to evaluate possible delayed side effects. At this time, no evidence of lasting genetic effects\u00a0[[30](#REF30)]\n\nProduction and Distribution Obstacles, Especially in Low-Income Nations: The Scalability of mRNA vaccines exists; however, production is costly because it requires specialized equipment, including lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery systems that protect and encapsulate the mRNA. These components are important for delivering mRNA to cells unharmed, but they also complicate the production process. In low-income countries, components of distribution - especially cold chain requirements, cost considerations, and infrastructure constraints - often complicate access to mRNA vaccines. Resolving these issues will require investments in cold chain technology, together with local vaccine production skills, as well as international partnerships to establish equitable access to these crucial vaccines\u00a0[[31](#REF31)].\n\nmRNA vaccine production and future manufacturing innovations\n\nCurrent Manufacturing Processes\n\nA review of the production process for mRNA vaccines:\u00a0The fabrication of mRNA vaccines includes a variety of important steps that set it apart from standard vaccine platforms. The identification of target antigens represents the initial requirement because antigens usually stem from viral proteins. Scientists use in vitro methods to synthesize mRNA encoding this antigen after its identification. The mRNA sequence originates from viral genomic material, and scientists have optimized it for human cell translation.\n\nRNA polymerase facilitates the in vitro generation of mRNA from DNA templates as an enzyme. Environmental quality stands as the main objective during a protocol that removes extra nucleotides and DNA templates from synthesized mRNA. The purified mRNA receives protection through lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which also help the material enter human cells [[32](#REF32)].\n\nThe Function of Lipid Nanoparticles (LNPs) in Vaccine Distribution:\u00a0The main operational role of LNPs exists for mRNA vaccines. Human enzymes known as RNases break down mRNA in the body, thus, the use of LNPs becomes necessary. The protective LNPs applied to mRNA create conditions for its survival and delivery to target cells without degradation. The design of LNPs achieves mRNA cellular uptake enhancement through endocytosis promotion, which represents the cellular process of substance intake. Inside the cell, LNPs unlock the mRNA and facilitate the movement to the cytoplasm, so it can synthesize the aimed protein. The lipid nanoparticles contain biodegradable lipids that are in harmony with human cells, thus lessening toxicity and improving efficiency in delivery [[28](#REF28)]. Improvements in LNP formulation have markedly enhanced the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines, making them an important part of the production process.\n\nFigure [6](#FIG6) demonstrates\u00a0the mRNA vaccine development process, starting with the discovery of a new virus, followed by genome sequencing to identify the genetic code of the viral protein of interest. Based on this information, scientists design the mRNA sequence that will instruct human cells to produce a harmless version of the viral protein, triggering an immune response. The designed sequence undergoes in vitro transcription, where it is converted into mRNA using enzymatic processes. The transcribed mRNA is then purified to remove unwanted components such as DNA templates, enzymes, and byproducts. Next, the purified mRNA is combined with four types of lipids in ethanol using a microfluidic mixing system to form mRNA lipid nanoparticles, which protect the mRNA and aid its delivery into human cells. This mixture is then diluted and ultrafiltered to remove solvents and adjust the concentration. Further filtration ensures sterility before the vaccine is finally filled into vials and capped, ready for distribution.\n\nInnovations in mRNA Vaccine Production\n\nProgress in Storage Stability along with Temperature Requirements:\u00a0One of the principal obstacles in the early deployment of mRNA vaccines was their requirement for ultra-low temperature storage. To demonstrate, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine needed storage at -70\u00b0C, which generated serious issues for distribution, particularly in regions lacking resources [[34](#REF34)]. Recent developments in mRNA formulation and stabilization have made it possible to maintain more flexible storage conditions. The Moderna mRNA vaccine, as an example, is engineered to maintain stability at -20\u00b0C and may remain stored in regular refrigeration (2-8\u00b0C) for up to 30 days [[35](#REF35)]. Investigators are working to improve the thermostability of mRNA vaccines by modifying the architecture of mRNA and the chemical makeup of lipid nanoparticles. The aim is to establish formulations that are stable at room temperature, which would greatly ease both distribution and storage, particularly in areas with inadequate cold chain infrastructure.\n\nEconomic Methods for Manufacturing and Distributing Products:\u00a0Scaling production to meet global demand has made the cost of manufacturing mRNA vaccines a major worry. Standard vaccine production technologies typically incorporate difficult biological methods, including the raising of viruses in cell cultures or eggs, whereas mRNA vaccines can result from chemical synthesis, thereby bringing down production time and costs. Improvements in high-throughput RNA synthesis in conjunction with automation and purification strategies have lowered the financial entry points to mRNA vaccine production, enhancing the capability for extensive rollout. Also, decentralized manufacturing models are under investigation to facilitate the placement of production facilities near areas of great demand. This technique can cut transportation costs and increase access in countries with low and middle incomes [[36](#REF36)]. Investigations by researchers into new lipid formulations and delivery systems are an important part of their work to boost cost-effectiveness by potentially lowering the need for cold storage, which can decrease distribution costs. The research team investigated dry powder formulations of mRNA vaccines over liquid versions because scientists believe these formulations would offer better stability and transport capabilities.\n\nThe Function of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Biology in the Creation of mRNA Vaccines:\u00a0The development of mRNA vaccines receives increasing benefits from artificial intelligence (AI) and computational biology applications in their design process. Large genetic and proteomic data are analyzed through AI algorithms to identify suitable antigenic targets for vaccine development. The applications enhance mRNA sequences through stability improvement and translation efficiency enhancement, and immunogenicity enhancement. The value of AI has become particularly noticeable in its capability to predict how tiny modifications in the mRNA sequence affect its secondary structure and subsequently affect protein translation efficiency. Researchers can more quickly assess and make changes to vaccine designs, thanks to models that use AI, which markedly lessens the time taken for development. Design is not the only recipient of AI's benefits; it's also supporting manufacturing. Machine learning algorithms analyze production data to show inefficiencies and offer improvements for the synthesis, purification, and formulation processes linked to mRNA vaccine production. Such a situation may produce improved production techniques and could also bring down costs [[37](#REF37)].\n\nEthical and regulatory considerations\n\nEthical Issues in mRNA Vaccine Deployment\n\nVaccine Equity - Access in Poor Countries vs. Rich Nations:\u00a0The principal ethical concern related to mRNA vaccines is the variation in access between countries with high income and nations that are developing. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, affluent nations could easily access large stocks of mRNA vaccines, while many countries of low and middle income had a hard time obtaining enough doses. This disparate distribution points out the requirement for international strategies to make certain that life-saving vaccines are reachable to all, without consideration of geographic or economic barriers [[38](#REF38)].\u00a0Global inequities in vaccine access during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for more robust international frameworks, such as equitable licensing and regional manufacturing capabilities [[16](#REF16)]. COVAX was designed\u00a0(by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), with UNICEF distribution support) to redress global vaccine inequality, but persistent issues related to logistics and inadequate infrastructure are still causing challenges to vaccine distribution in numerous parts of the world.\n\nEthical considerations emphasize transparent communication of risk-benefit profiles, particularly given the accelerated timelines and novel mechanisms of the mRNA platform. Those involved in trials need to be entirely aware of the risks and benefits associated with the vaccine, especially because of the novel characteristics of mRNA technology. As part of the emergency approval for COVID-19 vaccines, some raised alarms about the quickness of the trials and the possible inadequacy of patient education about long-term safety information. A pledge to ethical best practices demonstrates that clinical trials must follow exacting standards for informed consent while continuing dialogue about trial risks, outcomes, and benefits [[39](#REF39)].\n\nRegulatory Challenges\n\nFast-Track Approval Processes During Pandemics vs. Regular Approval Timelines:\u00a0To fast-track the deployment of mRNA vaccines, the COVID-19 pandemic created a need for emergency use authorizations (EUAs). Even so, the shortened approval process raises ambiguities about whether a detailed assessment of extensive safety and efficacy data has taken place [[40](#REF40)]. Addressing the public crisis requires this strategy.\n\nGlobal Harmonization of Regulatory Standards for mRNA Vaccines:\u00a0The major hurdle in mRNA vaccine regulation is the unavailability of globally consistent standards. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) require divergent criteria for the approval of vaccines. Due to the rising use of mRNA vaccines, there is a need for international regulatory systems to come into alignment so they can maintain safety, efficacy, and quality in global markets [[41](#REF41)].\n\nFuture directions and research gaps\n\nUnanswered Questions in mRNA Vaccine Research\n\nLong-range Immune Response and the Durability of Protection:\u00a0Despite promising short-term efficacy, the duration of immune protection induced by mRNA vaccines, particularly in the context of rapidly mutating viruses or immunocompromised hosts, remains to be fully established. Ongoing longitudinal studies are essential to determine booster requirements and correlate immune markers with protection. The vaccines have shown a strong production of neutralizing antibodies right after administration; however, it is still unclear for how long this protection holds and if booster doses will be essential to maintain immunity. Longitudinal studies are important for figuring out the total immunity time and, particularly, in response to viral mutations and variants that might influence the strength of the initial vaccine [[42](#REF42)].\n\nSafety in Special Populations:\u00a0A second major research topic focuses on making clear the safety and effectiveness of mRNA vaccines in special demographics, such as children, pregnant women, and those who are immunodeficient. During the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccines have been recommended for some populations, but there is still a deficit of data from large clinical trials that specifically assess their safety in these groups. The lack of representation of pregnancy in clinical trials has caused a careful approach to vaccine guidance for expectant mothers. Just as well, those with compromised immune systems, such as cancer patients throughout treatment and organ transplant patients, may manifest differing responses to mRNA vaccination, requiring additional work to alleviate these safety and efficacy issues [[43](#REF43)].\n\nNext-Generation mRNA Vaccines\n\nStudy on Self-Amplifying mRNA (saRNA) Vaccines:\u00a0Self-amplifying mRNA (saRNA) vaccines show great promise in the future as a research area of mRNA vaccine development.\u00a0saRNA platforms offer dose-sparing advantages and may enable more robust immune responses at lower mRNA quantities. However, challenges in safety, replicon stability, and large-scale Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) production need to be addressed before clinical translation. Unlike typical mRNA vaccines, which need large quantities of mRNA to provoke an immune response, saRNA vaccines carry additional sequences that permit the mRNA to duplicate itself inside the cell. The intensified amplification of itself may generate greater antigen production from a smaller beginning dose of mRNA, possibly necessitating a smaller vaccination amount and thereby cutting down production costs. First studies conducted in the preclinical phase reveal that saRNA vaccines can produce strong immune responses using fewer doses than conventional mRNA vaccines, which might allow for faster mass vaccination in global health crises [[44](#REF44)].\n\nRole of Combination Vaccines:\u00a0As mRNA technology evolves, the interest in developing combination vaccines that defend against several diseases with one dose is increasing. mRNA vaccines feature a flexible platform that permits the encoding of multiple antigens from assorted pathogens. To illustrate, work is underway to make combination mRNA vaccines that defend against both COVID-19 and influenza. The use of combination vaccines may be especially helpful in decreasing the number of injections needed for safeguarding against different diseases, raising vaccine compliance, and streamlining distribution [[45](#REF45)].\n\nProgress in mRNA Vaccines for Gene Editing and Therapeutics for Conditions Other Than Infectious Diseases:\u00a0Along with their applications in vaccines, researchers are also examining mRNA technologies for possible applications in gene editing and several other therapeutic fields. By allowing the encoding of proteins, mRNA is an optimistic tool for the treatment of genetic disorders that can directly convey therapeutic proteins to cells. Research is happening to produce mRNA therapies for conditions such as cystic fibrosis and particular types of muscular dystrophy. The look into mRNA technology includes its capacity for gene editing, mainly by delivering the CRISPR-Cas9 system through mRNA for precise genomic editing. The introduction of these therapeutic innovations expands the capabilities of mRNA beyond infectious diseases, preparing the ground for new treatments of genetic and chronic conditions [[46](#REF46)]. The future of mRNA vaccine technology shows promise, but it still has many unresolved questions. An examination of the sustained immune response and safety of vaccination in special populations, along with innovations such as self-amplifying mRNA and combination vaccines, is important for fully realizing the promise of mRNA vaccines. Research into mRNA for therapeutic purposes beyond infectious diseases may revolutionize treatment for genetic and chronic conditions, introducing a new direction for medicine.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nIn the future, the promise of mRNA vaccines applies to conditions outside of infectious diseases. Currently, researchers are hard at work using mRNA technology to construct vaccines and handle problems in cancer, autoimmune diseases, and chronic conditions. In the field of cancer treatment, mRNA vaccines have indicated a potential to generate immune responses directed at tumour-specific antigens, which is opening the avenue for personalized cancer immunotherapy. Inquiries into saRNA and combination vaccines propose the ability to significantly reduce vaccine doses, enable protection from several diseases with a single injection, and thus enhance the practicality and success of large vaccination plans. Research is in progress to examine the application of mRNA vaccines related to autoimmune diseases, together with gene therapy. The realm of mRNA's potential to encode therapeutic proteins is generating a lot of excitement among those who are exploring its application for conditions such as multiple sclerosis and cystic fibrosis, which have the potential to reshape the treatment landscape for genetic disorders and chronic health problems [[47](#REF47)].\n\nImportance of Continued Research and Development\n\nFor mRNA vaccines to completely fulfil their benefits, ongoing investment in research and development is needed. Unanswered questions remain about the extended immune response, the safety of special populations, and the capability of these vaccines to operate globally. The efficient deployment of mRNA vaccines on a global scale requires us to improve stability for simpler distribution and identify cost-effective manufacturing techniques. Also, for regulators, researchers, and the pharmaceutical field to cooperate is critical to overcome ethical difficulties, such as vaccine equity and the role of informed consent in clinical trials. The success of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 marks only the first step. Continuing our research efforts could allow mRNA technology to not just deal with pandemics, but also to change the global health landscape by addressing some of the most critical diseases of the moment, including cancer, autoimmune conditions, and newly emerging infectious diseases.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThe efficacy of mRNA vaccines in the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred a paradigm shift in vaccinology, proving the revolutionary power of this technology to fight infectious diseases. mRNA vaccines have many strengths over conventional vaccine platforms, such as speedy development, scalability, and high efficacy. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, for instance, had efficacy levels greater than 90% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 cases, representing a significant breakthrough for global health. Beyond COVID-19, mRNA technology offers a flexible platform that may transform vaccine development for numerous diseases, from emerging infectious diseases to re-emerging pathogens. Its potential for designing vaccines aimed at specific pathogens and individualized medicine, most notably in oncology, presents new opportunities to treat cancer by targeting patient-specific tumor antigens.\n\nIn the future, sustained innovation in thermostability, immune longevity, and individualized antigen design will play a pivotal role in realizing the full potential of mRNA vaccines, particularly in the domains of oncology, non-communicable diseases, and during pandemics in the future. International collaboration will also play a key role in addressing issues of ethics, logistics, and regulation, as well as in making these vaccines available equitably and under the same regulatory parameters globally. These initiatives will be instrumental to making sure that mRNA vaccines remain a force to be reckoned with in global health, revolutionizing the way we address diseases today and tomorrow.\n\n## Disclosures\n\n**Conflicts of interest:** In compliance with the ICMJE uniform disclosure form, all authors declare the following:\n\n**Payment/services info:** All authors have declared that no financial support was received from any organization for the submitted work.\n\n**Financial relationships:** All authors have declared that they have no financial relationships at present or within the previous three years with any organizations that might have an interest in the submitted work.\n\n**Other relationships:** All authors have declared that there are no other relationships or activities that could appear to have influenced the submitted work.\n\n## Author Contributions\n\n**Concept and design:**\u00a0 Somya Saxena, Wali Tariq, Kumar Sambhav, Vineet Mandrah, Papri Das, Salam Himika Devi\n\n**Acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data:**\u00a0 Somya Saxena, Wali Tariq, Kumar Sambhav, Vineet Mandrah, Papri Das, Salam Himika Devi\n\n**Drafting of the manuscript:**\u00a0 Somya Saxena, Wali Tariq, Kumar Sambhav, Vineet Mandrah, Papri Das, Salam Himika Devi\n\n**Critical review of the manuscript for important intellectual content:**\u00a0 Somya Saxena, Wali Tariq, Kumar Sambhav, Vineet Mandrah, Papri Das, Salam Himika Devi\n\n**Supervision:**\u00a0 Wali Tariq\n\n## References\n\n* 1.mRNA vaccines - a new era in vaccinology.

In recent years, Messenger RNA (mRNA) therapy has emerged as a highly promising treatment approach for various diseases caused by genetic mutations. Chemically modified mRNA is introduced into cells using carriers like lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs), producing functional proteins that compensate for genetic deficiencies. Given the advantages of precise dosing, biocompatibility, transient expression, and minimal risk of genomic integration, mRNA therapies can safely and effectively correct genetic defects in rare diseases and improve symptoms. Currently, dozens of mRNA drugs targeting rare diseases are undergoing clinical trials. This comprehensive review summarizes the progress of mRNA therapy in treating rare genetic diseases. It introduces the development, molecular design, and delivery systems of mRNA therapy, highlighting their research progress in rare genetic diseases based on protein replacement and gene editing. The review also summarizes research progress in various rare disease models and clinical trials. Additionally, it discusses the challenges and future prospects of mRNA therapy. Researchers are encouraged to join this field and collaborate to advance the clinical translation of mRNA therapy, bringing hope to patients with rare genetic diseases.\n\n## Graphical abstract\n\n## Introduction\n\nRare genetic diseases, also known as orphan diseases, are mostly caused by single gene defects [[1], [2], [3]]. Although each rare genetic disease is characterized by its low prevalence in the population, over 7000 rare diseases have been identified globally, collectively affecting more than 350 million people [4,5]. These diseases are severely debilitating and often drastically reduce life expectancy due to the lack of effective treatments, imposing a significant burden on patients worldwide [6,7]. The late diagnosis, insufficient research and development due to their low prevalence make treating rare genetic diseases remain a significant challenge [8,9]. Gene therapy has been studied to treat genetic diseases by aiming to correct genetic defects. However, it has faced setbacks due to some inherent limitations of viral vector-based delivery systems, such as strong immunogenicity, the risk of genomic integration, limited carrying capacity, difficulty in regulating gene expression, and complex production processes [[10], [11], [12], [13]]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop more advanced personalized medicines capable of safely and durably correcting disease-causing genetic defects.\n\nCurrently, strategies for treating rare genetic diseases include dietary control, organ transplantation, protein replacement therapy, small molecule chaperones, gene therapy (lentiviral, adeno-associated, adenoviral vectors) and gene editing [14](Fig. 1). However, these approaches have limitations. Dietary control often only provides limited disease alleviation, and patient compliance can be challenging. Organ transplantation can address the underlying cause of disease, but is hampered by difficulties in finding a suitable donor, high costs, and the need for lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. Although enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is common, it is ineffective for mutations that require the enzyme to function within cellular compartments like the mitochondria. Additionally, long-term use of recombinant enzymes can lead to resistance. In cystic fibrosis (CF), researchers have developed four cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators (Elexacaftor, Tezacaftor, Ivacaftor, and Lumacaftor) that can enhance CFTR protein function, increase chloride permeability, improve mucociliary clearance, and lung function. However, these drugs are only effective for specific F508del mutations [15]. To date, nine gene therapy products have been approved for rare diseases, half of which target hematologic disorders, including Roctavian (hemophilia A), Hemgenix (hemophilia B), Zynteglo (\u03b2-thalassemia), and Lyfgenia (Sickle cell disease, SCD). These gene therapies primarily use viral vectors for delivery, but challenges remain due to limitations of viral vector delivery systems (e.g., high immunogenicity, presence of pre-existing antibodies, risks of genomic integration, limited cargo capacity, difficulty regulating transgene expression, complex quality control and manufacturing processes, etc. [[10], [11], [12], [13]]. Another approach is gene editing, which is widely investigated for treating rare genetic diseases. Recently, the gene editing drug \u201cCASGEVY\u201d, based on the Exagamglogene Autotemcel (Exa-cel) platform, was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Commission for treating SCD and transfusion-dependent \u03b2-thalassemia. However, this is still limited to editing cells ex vivo before infusing them back into the patient, while in vivo editing has not yet achieved a breakthrough. Therefore, therapeutic modalities for rare genetic diseases still need to be developed to provide more options for patients.\n\nIn recent years, mRNA therapy has emerged as a promising approach in genetic disease treatment with several advantages, including biocompatibility, precise dosing, transient expression, and minimal risk of genomic integration [[16], [17], [18], [19]]. Chemical modifications of mRNA can potently reduce immunogenicity while increasing protein production, overcoming key limitations of previous nucleic acid therapies. Additionally, the modular design and mature manufacturing processes of mRNA therapies enable the rapid development of customized treatments for individual patients, which is crucial for heterogeneous rare genetic diseases. More importantly, mRNA therapy can safely restore missing or defective proteins by transient expression without changing genomic sequences, thus correcting underlying genetic defects while avoiding safety concerns from viral vector-mediated gene therapy like uncontrolled gene expression [[16], [17], [18], [19]]. Moreover, recent innovations in nanoparticle delivery systems, like LNPs, have enhanced mRNA stability and enabled efficient targeting to disease-relevant cells and tissues [[20], [21], [22], [23], [24]]. These characteristics make mRNA therapies an attractive option for genetic diseases previously considered difficult to treat or manage. Recent studies have demonstrated significant promise for mRNA therapy in rare genetic diseases, including glycogen storage disease (GSD) ([NCT05095727](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT05095727), [NCT04990388](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04990388)), propionic acidemia (PA) ([NCT04159103](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04159103), [NCT05130437](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT05130437)), ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTCD) ([NCT04442347](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04442347), [NCT05526066](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT05526066), [NCT03767270](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03767270)), methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) ([NCT04899310](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04899310)), CF ([NCT05668741](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT05668741)), and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) ([NCT05043181](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT05043181)). Besides these studies reported favorable treatment outcomes, clinical trials are actively underway. Ongoing advancements in delivery materials and mRNA molecular design strategies will also continue to improve the clinical applications of mRNA therapy.\n\nGiven the current lack of effective treatments for most rare genetic diseases, the importance of accelerating research into mRNA therapy cannot be overstated. This review focuses on the application of mRNA therapy in rare genetic diseases, aiming to shed light on the potential of mRNA therapy and provide hope to individuals and families affected by these diseases. Generally, we explore mRNA therapy development, mRNA molecular design, and various mRNA delivery systems. Furthermore, we highlight their research progress in rare genetic diseases based on protein replacement and gene editing. We also summarize current research progress in applying mRNA therapy to rare genetic diseases and emphasize the challenges and future prospects of this revolutionary approach. We also encourage more researchers to join the field, address ongoing scientific and clinical challenges, and expedite the clinical adoption of mRNA therapy.\n\n## Access through your organization\n\nCheck access to the full text by signing in through your organization.\n\n[Access through\u00a0**your organization**](/user/institution/login?targetUrl=%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fpii%2FS0168365924002207)\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## History of mRNA therapy\n\nmRNA was discovered in 1961 as a transient carrier transferring genetic information from DNA to proteins [25]. By the late 1980s, in vitro-transcribed (IVT) mRNA technology had gradually matured with the commercialization of Cap analog and T7 RNA polymerases [17,26]. mRNA was successfully delivered to mouse muscle in vivo in 1990. In 2002, the first clinical trial was conducted, in which mRNA-engineered dendritic cells (DCs) were used to stimulate antitumor immune response [27]. mRNA\n\n## mRNA therapy for rare genetic diseases\n\nA heterogeneous collection of disorders known as rare genetic diseases are typically caused by abnormalities in a single gene and manifest as autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked inheritance pattern. Rare genetic diseases affect a small percentage of the population, they frequently represent serious, chronic, and life-threatening conditions. These diseases have historically been understudied and lacked treatment options due to their rarity. However, with advancements in\n\n## The limitations/challenges of mRNA therapy\n\nThe success of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine has revived interest in utilizing mRNA for expressing therapeutic proteins. Several mRNA therapies focusing on protein replacement and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing are undergoing clinical evaluation to treat rare genetic diseases (Table 2). However, urgent innovations are imperative to surmount these challenges before mRNA can be established as a universal therapeutic modality for rare gene diseases.\n\nAlthough most current mRNA therapies have exhibited\n\n## Conclusion and outlook\n\nGenetic diseases, especially rare monogenic diseases caused by single-gene mutations, have long posed a significant challenge in the field of medicine. These diseases are often referred to as orphan diseases because they affect relatively few individuals and, compared to more common diseases, may not attract the attention of pharmaceutical companies. However, the impact of these genetic diseases on patients and their families can be devastating, as they often lead to severe, and even\n\n## CRediT authorship contribution statement\n\n**Guobo Shen:** Writing \u2013 original draft, Conceptualization. **Jian Liu:** Writing \u2013 original draft. **Hanmei Yang:** Writing \u2013 original draft. **Na Xie:** Writing \u2013 review & editing, Conceptualization. **Yang Yang:** Writing \u2013 review & editing, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Conceptualization.\n\n## Declaration of competing interest\n\nAll authors declare no conflicts of interest.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82222030 and U19A2002) and the Frontiers Medical Center, Tianfu Jincheng Laboratory Foundation (TFJC2023010001).

Messenger RNA (mRNA) has emerged as a promising therapy for treating NDD, as it can encode missing or dysfunctional proteins and anti-inflammatory cytokines or neuroprotective proteins to halt the progression of these diseases. However, effective mRNA delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) remains a significant challenge due to the limited penetration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) offer an efficient solution by encapsulating and protecting mRNA, facilitating transfection and intracellular delivery. This review discusses the pathophysiological mechanisms of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Huntington's disease (HD), ischemic stroke, spinal cord injury, and Friedreich's ataxia. Additionally, it explores the potential of LNP-mediated mRNA delivery as a therapeutic strategy for these diseases. Various approaches to overcoming BBB-related challenges and enhancing the delivery and efficacy of mRNA-LNPs are discussed, including non-invasive methods with strong potential for clinical translation. With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI)-guided mRNA and LNP design, targeted delivery, gene editing, and CAR-T cell therapy, mRNA-LNPs could significantly transform the treatment landscape for NDD, paving the way for future clinical applications.\n* ### [Considerations for mRNA Product Development, Regulation and Deployment Across the Lifecycle](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines13050473)\n\n  2025, Vaccines\n* ### [Deciphering the Role of PEGylation on the Lipid Nanoparticle-Mediated mRNA Delivery to the Liver](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c09399)\n\n  2025, ACS Nano\n* ### [RNA nanotherapeutics for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment](https://doi.org/10.7150/thno.102964)\n\n  2025, Theranostics\n* ### [Progress and prospects of mRNA-based drugs in pre-clinical and clinical applications](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-024-02002-z)\n\n  2024, Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy\n* ### [Research progress on the quality control of mRNA vaccines](https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2024.2354251)\n\n  2024, Expert Review of Vaccines\n\n[View all citing articles on Scopus](http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/citedby.url?partnerID=10&rel=3.0.0&eid=2-s2.0-85190998441&md5=6f2a85e3f01311609a7b2462b6e1541)\n\n[1](#bfn0005)\n:   These authors contributed equally to the manuscript.\n\n[View full text](/science/article/pii/S0168365924002207)\n\n\u00a9 2024 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional vaccine development cycles are lengthy and struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving viruses, whereas messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines have demonstrated significant advantages due to their short development periods, straightforward production, and low costs. After the outbreak of the COVID\u201019 pandemic, multiple mRNA vaccines, including Pfizer\u2010BioNTech and Moderna, rapidly received emergency use authorization, validating their feasibility. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2023 was awarded to Katalin Karik\u00f3 and Drew Weissman, underscoring the efficacy of mRNA vaccine technology. In 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Moderna's respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) mRNA vaccine marked the immense potential of mRNA technology in vaccine innovation. This review article summarizes the design, clinical research, and future challenges of mRNA vaccines for respiratory viruses, delving into antigen design, mRNA delivery systems, and advancements in vaccines for multiple respiratory viruses, including innovations in self\u2010amplifying mRNA and circular mRNA vaccines. Additionally, the development of combination vaccines is underway, aiming to provide protection against multiple viruses through a single administration. Despite the significant progress in mRNA vaccine development, challenges remain regarding raw material costs, stability, and delivery efficiency. In the future, with technological advancements and the accumulation of clinical experience, the design strategies and delivery systems of mRNA vaccines are expected to be continuously optimized, thereby enhancing their safety and efficacy.\n\n**Keywords:** coronavirus, influenza, mRNA vaccines, respiratory virus, RSV\n\n---\n\n## 1. INTRODUCTION\n\nRespiratory infectious diseases have repeatedly surged globally in recent years, posing severe risks to human health, with viral infections accounting for a significant proportion. Among respiratory viruses, most, including coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and rhinoviruses, are single\u2010stranded RNA viruses prone to mutation, with only a few, such as adenoviruses and bocaviruses, classified as DNA viruses. The mutability of RNA viruses continues to complicate the development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines. For instance, the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Omicron variant exhibits extensive mutations, including 36 mutations located on the spike protein, rendering neutralizing antibodies targeting SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 less effective or entirely ineffective against Omicron. [1](#ame270018-bib-0001) ,  [2](#ame270018-bib-0002) ,  [3](#ame270018-bib-0003) ,  [4](#ame270018-bib-0004) ,  [5](#ame270018-bib-0005) ,  [6](#ame270018-bib-0006)  Consequently, vaccine designs for respiratory viruses require continual updates to address emerging variants. Traditional vaccine development and regulatory timelines are often too protracted to meet the demands posed by rapidly evolving acute viral pathogens. In contrast, messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines offer significant advantages for emergency vaccine development against respiratory viruses, given their shorter development cycles, simpler production processes, lower costs, and rapid scalability. [7](#ame270018-bib-0007)\n\nFollowing the onset of the COVID\u201019 pandemic, Pfizer (US) and BioNTech (Germany) jointly developed the BNT162 vaccine, [8](#ame270018-bib-0008)  while Moderna developed mRNA\u20101273 [9](#ame270018-bib-0009) ,  [10](#ame270018-bib-0010) ; both vaccines received emergency use authorization across multiple nations and were administered globally, demonstrating the feasibility of mRNA vaccines. This pivotal advancement has ushered in a new era of vaccine development. In October 2023, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Katalin Karik\u00f3 and Drew Weissman for their foundational discoveries in nucleoside base modification, which enabled the development of effective COVID\u201019 mRNA vaccines. This prestigious recognition underscores the validated utility of mRNA vaccine technology in the COVID\u201019 pandemic. On May 31, 2024, Moderna announced that its RSV mRNA vaccine, mRESVIA, received U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval, [11](#ame270018-bib-0011) ,  [12](#ame270018-bib-0012)  marking a milestone that highlights the expansive future potential of mRNA technology in vaccine innovation. Studies have demonstrated that booster doses significantly enhance neutralizing antibody levels and broaden immune responses against variants, thereby playing a critical role in sustaining immunity, especially against rapidly mutating viruses such as SARS\u2010CoV\u20102. [13](#ame270018-bib-0013)  In the coming years, additional mRNA vaccines targeting respiratory viruses are anticipated to enter the market, offering new preventive and therapeutic solutions for global public health.\n\nThis article systematically reviews the current status and advancements of mRNA vaccines used clinically and those undergoing clinical trials. It provides a comprehensive synthesis from multiple perspectives, including antigen design, mRNA delivery, and administration strategies, as well as the clinical progress of various respiratory virus vaccines.\n\n## 2. ANTIGEN DESIGN\n\nThe selection of target antigens, optimization of sequence design, and the delivery system are critical determinants of the core competitiveness of mRNA vaccines. [8](#ame270018-bib-0008) ,  [14](#ame270018-bib-0014)  As a key component recognized by the immune system to induce a specific immune response, antigen is pivotal in the development of respiratory virus vaccine. Choosing the appropriate viral protein as the antigen to elicit a robust immune response is a crucial first step. Sequence optimization can further enhance the mRNA's expression levels, prolong its retention time, and reduce immunogenicity. Meanwhile, the delivery system acts as an efficient vehicle to protect and transport the active components to the target sites for timely release; few companies possess this technology, which is patent\u2010protected and represents a \u201cchokepoint\u201d in mRNA vaccine technology.\n\n### 2.1. Selection of key antigens\n\nThe first step in vaccine design is the selection of core viral antigens. For instance, in developing the RSV mRNA vaccine, Moderna compared several antigenic forms, including the wild\u2010type full\u2010length RSV F protein derived from the RSV A2 strain (mF), the truncated secreted trimeric form of RSV F (sF), the pre\u2010fusion stabilized F protein (DS\u2010Cav1), the monomeric pre\u2010fusion single\u2010chain RSV F form (RSV F5), and other reported full\u2010length RSV F proteins (RSV F7) and pre\u2010fusion stabilized RSV F (RSV F8). Immunogenicity testing revealed that the pre\u2010fusion configuration (DS\u2010Cav1) was most effective in inducing a potent neutralizing antibody response and generating a strong neutralizing immune response. [15](#ame270018-bib-0015)\n\nIn influenza vaccines, the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins are commonly targeted due to their critical roles in viral entry and replication. [16](#ame270018-bib-0016)  The high mutation rate of the influenza virus presents major challenges for vaccine development. Key issues include antigenic drift, where frequent mutations in the HA and NA proteins diminish vaccine efficacy [17](#ame270018-bib-0017) ; the need for broad protection, which requires multivalent vaccines targeting conserved viral regions to ensure widespread immunity; and the demand for rapid adaptation met by mRNA platforms that enable swift updates to match circulating strains, thus effectively addressing the virus's rapid mutations. [18](#ame270018-bib-0018)\n\nFuture research should focus on identifying conserved antigens across multiple respiratory viruses to develop broad\u2010spectrum vaccines that offer protection against a wider range of pathogens.\n\n### 2.2. Optimization of mRNA sequence\n\nTo accurately mimic the biological function of natural mRNA transcripts in protein translation, an mRNA sequence comprises five critical structural elements: the 5\u2032 cap, 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), coding sequence (CDS), 3\u2019 UTR, and poly(A) tail, all of which contribute to antigen expression and structural stability. mRNA sequences undergo multiple strategies to enhance antigen immunogenicity, including codon optimization, UTR refinement, AI\u2010assisted structural design, and the incorporation of immunoregulatory elements.\n\nNucleoside base modification, for instance, replacing uridine (U) with pseudouridine (\u03a8) or other modifications, enhances mRNA stability and translation efficiency. [19](#ame270018-bib-0019)  Codon optimization is a key step aimed at improving the stability and translational efficiency of the mRNA sequence to maximize vaccine efficacy. Codon adaptation is also adjusted to align with the host cell's codon usage, achieving a codon adaptation index (CAI) that promotes optimal expression in host cells. In the approved RSV mRNA vaccine, mRNA\u20101345, the coding sequence includes four mutations (as in DS\u2010Cav1): S155C, S290C, S190F, and V207L, with S155C and S290C mutations forming disulfide bonds, whereas S190F and V207L mutations function as cavity\u2010filling alterations. Furthermore, the pre\u2010F protein encoded by mRNA\u20101345 contains two additional mutations (A149C and Y458C) in the F1 domain, and the 104\u2013144 amino acid residues are replaced by a GS linker, with the cytoplasmic tail deleted.\n\nDistinct 5\u2019 UTR sequences may be required for different mRNA sequences and target cells. [20](#ame270018-bib-0020)  Notably, the 5\u2019 UTR of mRNA\u20101345 is shorter than that of the COVID\u201019 mRNA vaccine mRNA\u20101273, lacking a GC\u2010rich segment, whereas the 3\u2019 UTR sequences of both vaccines are identical, differing by only two nucleotides. The KOZAK sequence and Poly(A) tail sequence remain consistent, and both terminate with a tandem arrangement of three distinct stop codons. AI\u2010assisted design enables more efficient mRNA sequence optimization by predicting and refining RNA and protein structures, thereby accelerating drug and vaccine development. [7](#ame270018-bib-0007)\n\n### 2.3. Self\u2010amplifying mRNA and circular mRNA vaccines\n\nSelf\u2010amplifying RNA (saRNA) differs from conventional mRNA in its capacity for self\u2010replication using its own RNA sequence as a template. Typically, mRNA encodes the target protein, which is translated by ribosomes in the cell. In contrast, saRNA not only expresses the target protein but also includes sequences that code for RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). [21](#ame270018-bib-0021) ,  [22](#ame270018-bib-0022)  This polymerase enables replication of the saRNA, thereby reducing the required dose and lowering production costs. Therapeutically, this reduces the injection dose and frequency needed in mRNA treatments, extends therapeutic efficacy, and minimizes potential side effects associated with the mRNA and delivery vector. In November 2023, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved ARCT\u2010154, a saRNA COVID\u201019 vaccine developed jointly by Arcturus Therapeutics and CSL. This marked the first nonemergency clinical application of saRNA technology. Compared to the 100\u2010\u03bcg dose of Moderna's mRNA vaccine and the 30\u2010\u03bcg dose of BioNTech/Pfizer's mRNA vaccine, ARCT\u2010154 requires only a 5\u2010\u03bcg dose. Clinical trials have shown that ARCT\u2010154, as a booster in individuals who received three doses of an mRNA COVID\u201019 vaccine, elicited an immune response against SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 Wuhan\u2010Hu\u20101 comparable to that of BNT162b2. Furthermore, in neutralization assays against the Omicron BA.4/5 variant, ARCT\u2010154 outperformed BNT162b2. Both vaccines demonstrated strong tolerability and safety profiles in the study population. [23](#ame270018-bib-0023)\n\nCircular mRNA (circRNA) vaccines have recently emerged as an innovative approach in vaccine development. In July 2018, Daniel Anderson and colleagues at MIT demonstrated that engineered circRNA could stably and efficiently express proteins in eukaryotic cells, establishing a new application for exogenous circRNA in protein expression. This finding highlighted circRNA as an effective alternative to linear mRNA. Compared to conventional linear mRNA vaccines, circRNA's unique circular structure eliminates the need for a costly 5\u2032 cap and extensive 3\u2032 tail, conferring potential advantages such as increased stability and enhanced immunogenicity. [24](#ame270018-bib-0024)  CircRNA's stability under ambient conditions suggests that it could be used in vaccines that can be stored without a cold chain. Currently, most circRNA vaccines remain in experimental and early\u2010stage clinical trials, as researchers continue to assess their safety and immunogenicity.\n\n### 2.4. Combination vaccines\n\nCombination vaccines integrate two or more antigen components into a single vaccine, enabling immunoprotection against multiple respiratory viruses through a single administration. This approach streamlines vaccination schedules, improves vaccination efficiency, and reduces the incidence of respiratory diseases. Such vaccines commonly include antigens targeting prevalent respiratory viruses such as influenza, RSV, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza virus.\n\nIn June 2024, Moderna's investigational combination vaccine, mRNA\u20101083, targeting both COVID\u201019 and influenza, reached its primary endpoints in a Phase III trial. In adults aged 50\u201364 and those 65 and older, mRNA\u20101083 induced a more robust immune response against both influenza and COVID\u201019 compared to existing single\u2010antigen vaccines. The vaccine is expected to undergo regulatory review by the end of 2024, with plans to accelerate its market availability under priority review status. [25](#ame270018-bib-0025) ,  [26](#ame270018-bib-0026)\n\nMeanwhile, researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, developed an experimental multivalent mRNA vaccine targeting all 20 known subtypes of influenza viruses, covering both influenza A and B strains. This multivalent mRNA vaccine demonstrated broad protective efficacy in mice by inducing antibodies against various influenza subtypes. It leverages the same mRNA platform as Pfizer's and Moderna's SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 vaccines. [16](#ame270018-bib-0016)  Testing in animal models showed that the vaccine alleviated symptoms of influenza and protected animals from death, even when exposed to influenza strains differing from those used in vaccine formulation.\n\n## 3. DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND ADMINISTRATION ROUTES FOR MRNA VACCINES\n\n### 3.1. Delivery systems\n\nThe considerable molecular weight of mRNA (104\u2013106\u2009Da) and its inherent negative charge impede its ability to traverse the anionic lipid bilayer of cellular membranes. Furthermore, mRNA is prone to degradation and recognition by the immune system in\u00a0vivo, underscoring the necessity for a robust delivery system that not only protects mRNA but also facilitates its entry into target cells. Commonly employed delivery systems include lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), cationic liposomes, polymers, and extracellular vesicles. Lipid\u2010based mRNA carriers typically adhere to specific criteria: stable nanostructure effectively protect the mRNA payload, reduced recognition by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) and clearance by renal filtration, and all lipid components should be biodegradable. Targeted biodistribution of lipid nanoparticle\u2013mRNA formulations can be improved by further modifying and optimizing the nanoparticle, or by adjusting the proportions of lipid components. [27](#ame270018-bib-0027)\n\nCurrently, clinically approved LNP formulations are composed of four types of lipids: ionizable cationic lipids, cholesterol, PEGylated lipids, and phospholipids. Through the application of microfluidic mixing techniques, mRNA is encapsulated within LNPs formed from these components in precise ratios. The selection of both components and their respective proportions is critical for the successful delivery of mRNA via LNPs. Researchers have established extensive libraries of ionizable lipids specifically for mRNA delivery, with prominent examples including DLin\u2010MC3\u2010DMA, SM\u2010102, and ALC\u20100315. These lipids are recognized as FDA\u2010approved cationic lipids for RNA delivery, with SM\u2010102 and ALC\u20100315 serving as key constituents of the FDA\u2010approved mRNA vaccines mRNA\u20101273 and BNT162b, respectively, for COVID\u201019 prevention. DLin\u2010MC3\u2010DMA, which is FDA\u2010approved for small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery in Onpattro, has also been widely used in mRNA applications. [28](#ame270018-bib-0028)  Each component plays a vital role in enhancing the overall immunogenicity of RNA\u2010LNP formulations, which is essential for their therapeutic efficacy. However, the intricate mechanisms and interactions at play\u2014particularly the influence of specific lipid structures, such as the number and length of lipid \u201ctails\u201d and the characteristics of the headgroups\u2014on the immunogenicity of LNP formulations remain inadequately understood. [29](#ame270018-bib-0029)\n\nRecent advancements have seen researchers optimize the composition, structure, and manufacturing processes of LNPs to augment the delivery efficiency, safety, and stability of mRNA vaccines. [30](#ame270018-bib-0030)  In 2024, a collaborative study by researchers from the School of Pharmacy at Zhejiang University, including Dr. Shuai Liu, Professor Zhen Gu, and Professor Ping Yuan, reported the development of a streamlined three\u2010component LNP system (comprising nAcx\u2010Cm lipids, permanent cationic lipids, and PEGylated lipids). This innovative approach enabled simultaneous mRNA accumulation and translation in the lungs and liver, achieving targeted organ delivery while minimizing adverse effects. [31](#ame270018-bib-0031)\n\nThe utilization of extracellular vesicles as delivery systems for mRNA vaccines represents an emerging and promising area of research. This strategy harnesses plant\u2010derived extracellular vesicles as natural carriers for the safe and effective delivery of mRNA vaccines to target cells. Preliminary studies suggest that oral delivery methods can yield favorable outcomes; however, significant improvements in production scalability, cost\u2010effectiveness, and delivery efficiency are imperative for future advancements. [32](#ame270018-bib-0032)\n\n### 3.2. Administration routes\n\nTypically, mRNA vaccines for COVID\u201019 are administered via intramuscular injection, specifically into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. This administration route ensures the rapid entry of the vaccine components into the systemic circulation. Although less common, some mRNA vaccines are delivered through subcutaneous injection, which involves administering the vaccine into the subcutaneous adipose tissue beneath the skin.\n\nRecent studies are investigating alternative delivery methods, such as nasal spray or inhalation, which aim to mimic the natural infection pathways of respiratory viruses and may enhance the immunogenicity of respiratory virus vaccines. Research conducted by scientists at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) involved administering a single dose of the Ad26 vaccine through three different routes: intramuscular injection, intranasal delivery (via nasal spray), and tracheal delivery (using nebulizers or inhalers) in three groups of rhesus macaques. [33](#ame270018-bib-0033) ,  [34](#ame270018-bib-0034)  The findings revealed that direct administration of the COVID\u201019 vaccine to the trachea induced a more robust mucosal immune response compared to both intramuscular and intranasal delivery methods. These results support the feasibility of developing vaccines specifically targeting respiratory virus infections.\n\nFurthermore, Professor Giovanni Camussi from the University of Turin has validated the feasibility of using orange\u2010derived extracellular vesicles as a delivery system for oral capsule formulations of mRNA vaccines. The S1\u2010mRNA encapsulated within orange\u2010derived extracellular vesicles was freeze\u2010dried and subsequently encapsulated in capsules, demonstrating stability at room temperature for up to 1\u2009year without compromising the integrity of the extracellular vesicles or the mRNA. This oral capsule formulation has also been shown to effectively induce immune responses in rats, efficiently triggering cellular immunity (Figure\u00a0[1](#ame270018-fig-0001)).\n\n## 4. CLINICAL RESEARCH PROGRESS OF MRNA VACCINES FOR RESPIRATORY VIRUSES\n\nmRNA vaccines represent a novel and efficient strategy for combating infections caused by rapidly mutating respiratory viruses, offering significant public health advantages for disease prevention and control. The rapid development of mRNA vaccines is facilitated by their reliance on established technological platforms, which allow for swift modifications of antigen sequences. This results in shorter development timelines, simplified production processes, lower costs, and suitability for large\u2010scale manufacturing. mRNA vaccines have played a pivotal role in the defense against viruses such as SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, RSV, and influenza.\n\nSince the outbreak of the COVID\u201019 pandemic, global research institutions and pharmaceutical companies have invested substantial resources into the development of mRNA vaccines targeting SARS\u2010CoV\u20102, leading to the approval of multiple vaccines. The mRESVIA (mRNA\u20101345) developed by Moderna is the first non\u2010COVID mRNA vaccine to receive regulatory approval globally, marking it as the third RSV vaccine approved, following Pfizer's Abrysvo and GlaxoSmithKline's Arexvy. Concurrently, nearly a dozen other mRNA vaccines designed for the treatment and prevention of RSV are currently undergoing clinical trials.\n\nAlthough no mRNA vaccines for influenza have yet been approved, preliminary results from early\u2010phase clinical trials suggest that influenza virus mRNA vaccines show promise in terms of safety and efficacy. The flexibility of mRNA technology enables rapid adjustments to vaccine sequences, allowing for adaptation to circulating strains of influenza virus, thereby enhancing the response to viral mutations. Researchers are actively developing multivalent mRNA vaccines that can simultaneously protect against multiple subtypes of influenza virus, offering broader immunity. However, further research and large\u2010scale clinical trials are essential to validate their efficacy and safety.\n\n### 4.1. Clinical progress of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 mRNA vaccines\n\nSARS\u2010CoV\u20102 is a single\u2010stranded positive\u2010sense RNA enveloped virus whose genome encodes several proteins, including the envelope protein (E), membrane protein (M), nucleocapsid protein (N), and spike protein (S). During the infection of human cells, the spike protein trimers of the virus bind to the angiotensin\u2010converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the surface of host cells. This interaction is subsequently cleaved by the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), inducing conformational changes that expose the fusion peptide of the spike protein and facilitate viral membrane fusion. [35](#ame270018-bib-0035) ,  [36](#ame270018-bib-0036)  After the outbreak of the COVID\u201019 pandemic, the virus and its various variants (including Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Omicron BA.5, BA.7, KP.1.1, KP.2, KP.3.1.1 etc. [18](#ame270018-bib-0018) ,  [37](#ame270018-bib-0037) ,  [38](#ame270018-bib-0038) ) spread widely across the globe, significantly disrupting daily life and posing immense challenges to public health systems. This situation prompted collaboration among multiple countries and companies to accelerate vaccine and therapeutic development, leading to the rapid emergence of COVID\u201019 mRNA vaccines that received Emergency Use Authorization or approval, providing essential tools for epidemic control. These vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy and safety in preventing SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 infection, alleviating symptoms, and reducing the risk of severe disease. [39](#ame270018-bib-0039)\n\nDr. Peter Marks, Director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, has emphasized the importance of administering updated vaccines to prevent current circulating variants, particularly as public immunity may be waning. In June 2024, the FDA requested vaccine manufacturers to produce vaccines targeting the JN.1 strain and, where feasible, the KP.2 strain. On August 22, 2024, updated versions of the COVID\u201019 vaccines developed by Pfizer (PFE.US) and Moderna (MRNA.US) received approval, specifically targeting the KP.2 strain. Both companies indicated that the updated vaccines are expected to elicit a stronger immune response against JN.1 and other circulating subtypes compared to last year's vaccines that targeted the Omicron XBB.1.5 variant. In contrast, NVAX.US's NVX\u2010CoV2373 vaccine, which employs protein\u2010based technology, has demonstrated a slower update pace compared to the mRNA vaccines developed by Pfizer and Moderna. The company has applied for authorization of a new JN.1 vaccine but has not yet received FDA approval (Table\u00a0[1](#ame270018-tbl-0001)).\n\n#### TABLE 1.\n\nThe approved messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against COVID\u201019.\n\n| No. | Drug name | Target | Original research institution | Phase | Approved date |\n| 1 | Bivalent COVID\u201019 mRNA vaccine (CSPC Pharmaceutical) | SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2009S protein containing BA.5 key mutations | CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Limited | Approved | 2023\u201012\u201001 |\n| 2 | SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 mRNA vaccine (variants) (Walvax Biotechnology) | SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2009S protein | Yunnan Walvax Biotechnology Co., Ltd. | Shanghai Blue Magpie Biomedical Co., Ltd. | Fudan University | Approved | 2023\u201012\u201001 |\n| 3 | Zapomeran | SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2009S protein | Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings, Inc. | Approved | 2023\u201009\u201005 |\n| 4 | Bemremeran | SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2009S protein | Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. | Approved | 2023\u201008\u201002 |\n| 5 | HIPRA SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 (Laboratorios HIPRA) | SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2009S protein | Laboratorios HIPRA SA | Approved | 2023\u201003\u201030 |\n| 6 | COVID\u201019 mRNA vaccine (SYS6006) | SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2009S protein | CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Limited | Approved | 2023\u201003\u201022 |\n| 7 | COVID\u201019\u2010mRNA vaccine (Stemirna Therapeutics) | SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2009S protein | SMICell (Shanghai) Biotechnology Co., Ltd. | Approved | 2022\u201012\u201008 |\n| 8 | Elasomeran/Davesomeran | SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2009S protein | Moderna, Inc. | Approved | 2022\u201011\u201003 |\n| 9 | ARCoV(Walvax Biotechnology) | SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2009S protein | Yunnan Walvax Biotechnology Co., Ltd. | Academy of Military Sciences of the Chinese People's Liberation Army | Suzhou Abogen Biosciences Co., Ltd. | Approved | 2022\u201009\u201030 |\n| 10 | COVID\u201019 vaccine(HDT Bio) | SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2009S protein | HDT Bio Corp. | Approved | 2022\u201006\u201029 |\n| 11 | Elasomeran/Imelasomeran | SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2009S protein | Moderna, Inc. | Approved | 2021\u201005\u201021 |\n| 12 | Elasomeran(mRNA\u20101273) | SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2009S protein | Moderna, Inc. | Approved | 2020\u201012\u201023 |\n| 13 | BNT162b2 | SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2009S protein | BioNTech SE | Approved | 2020\u201012\u201002 |\n\n[Open in a new tab](table/ame270018-tbl-0001/)\n\nIn addition to traditional linear mRNA vaccines, the ARCT\u2010154 vaccine, codeveloped by CSL and Arcturus Therapeutics, was approved in April 2024 as the first commercially available saRNA vaccine. SaRNA technology allows for high\u2010level and sustained expression of target proteins at low doses. Furthermore, a team led by Wei Wensheng at Peking University has developed a circular RNA vaccine encoding the receptor\u2010binding domain (RBD) of the SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 spike protein (Table\u00a0[1](#ame270018-tbl-0001)). This vaccine has been shown to induce greater production of neutralizing antibodies and more effective T\u2010cell responses compared to traditional linear mRNA vaccines, with data published in Cell in 2022. [40](#ame270018-bib-0040)\n\n### 4.2. Clinical progress of influenza virus mRNA vaccines\n\nInfluenza viruses, belonging to the Orthomyxoviridae family, are enveloped negative\u2010sense RNA viruses that cause significant seasonal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Clinical manifestations typically arise 1 to 4\u2009days postinfection and persist for approximately 1\u2009week. Although the symptoms are often self\u2010limiting in healthy individuals, the burden of disease escalates dramatically among vulnerable populations, including those with underlying health conditions. According to World Health Organization (WHO) reports, seasonal influenza leads to approximately 1 billion cases annually, with 3 to 5 million severe cases and an estimated 2\u200990\u2009000 to 6\u200950\u2009000 deaths attributed to respiratory diseases. [41](#ame270018-bib-0041)\n\nInfluenza viruses are categorized into four primary types: A, B, C, and D, with types A and B being the most relevant for seasonal epidemics. Influenza A viruses are further subdivided into multiple subtypes based on the surface proteins HA and NA, with H1N1 and H3N2 being the currently predominant strains. The ability of influenza viruses to undergo rapid antigenic drift necessitates the frequent production of updated vaccines; thus, adaptive mutations in vaccine strains generated in embryonated chicken eggs can alter protective efficacy. Consequently, vaccine reformulation is required biannually to mitigate viral transmission. Organizations such as the WHO convene regularly to assess circulating strains and provide recommendations for vaccine formulations suitable for global distribution. The mRNA vaccine platform offers distinct advantages, including rapid scalability and the avoidance of the need for embryonated eggs or cell cultures, thereby circumventing the risks of adaptive mutations while effectively addressing the rapid antigenic variability of the virus. [17](#ame270018-bib-0017)\n\nModerna is developing multiple candidate influenza vaccines currently in clinical evaluation, including mRNA\u20101010, which has demonstrated both safety and immunogenicity in Phase III clinical trials. [42](#ame270018-bib-0042)  Other candidates in the pipeline include next\u2010generation influenza vaccines, such as mRNA\u20101020 and mRNA\u20101030, which target more conserved antigens and are currently in Phase II trials. The application of mRNA technology has brought novel opportunities for the development of combination vaccines targeting multiple respiratory pathogens. The mRNA platform allows for enhanced flexibility in the design and production of vaccine components against various pathogens. Among the Phase I trial candidates is mRNA\u20101045, a combination vaccine targeting both influenza and RSV. Pfizer and BioNTech have expanded their collaboration to establish a robust pipeline of mRNA vaccines. Preliminary findings from Phase III trials of their candidate PF\u201007252220 for influenza and respiratory diseases indicate superior efficacy in individuals aged 18 to 64 compared to existing influenza vaccines. However, this candidate achieved secondary immunogenicity endpoints solely for influenza A strains, with results from trials involving individuals aged 65 and older anticipated later this year. Both companies have indicated the potential for adjustments to the candidate, although such modifications could result in delays in securing any possible approvals. Initial results suggest that certain combination vaccines hold promise in eliciting immune responses; however further large\u2010scale clinical trials are essential to confirm their long\u2010term efficacy and safety. Concurrently, ongoing optimization studies regarding vaccine formulation, dosing, and administration protocols are being conducted to enhance the efficacy and acceptability of the vaccines. The interplay between different pathogen components and the balance of immune responses necessitates continued research and innovation for effective optimization (Table\u00a0[2](#ame270018-tbl-0002)).\n\n#### TABLE 2.\n\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against flu virus and combined antigens.\n\n| No. | Drug name | NCT number | Indication | Original research institution | Phase |\n| 1 | PF\u201007252220 | [NCT05540522](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05540522) | Influenza | BioNTech SE | Pfizer Inc. | III |\n| 2 | mRNA\u20101010 | [NCT05827068](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05827068) | Influenza | Moderna, Inc. | III |\n| 3 | mRNA\u20101083 | [NCT06097273](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06097273)  [NCT06508320](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06508320) | Influenza | Moderna, Inc. | III |\n| 4 | mRNA\u20101073 | [NCT05375838](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05375838) | Influenza and COVID\u201019 | Moderna, Inc. | I/II |\n| 5 | mRNA\u20101020 /mRNA1030 | [NCT05333289](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05333289) | influenza | Moderna, Inc. | I/II |\n| 6 | mRNA\u20101012 | [NCT05827068](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05827068) | Influenza | Moderna, Inc. | II |\n| 7 | mRNA\u20101045 | [NCT05585632](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05585632) | Influenza, COVID\u201019, SARS, and RSV | Moderna, Inc. | I |\n| 8 | mRNA\u20101230 | [NCT05585632](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05585632) | Influenza, COVID\u201019, SARS, and RSV | Moderna, Inc. | I |\n| 9 | mRNA\u20101365 | [NCT05743881](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05743881) | Influenza and HMPV | Moderna, Inc. | I |\n| 10 | GSK\u20104382276A | [NCT06431607](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06431607) | Influenza | GSK Plc | II |\n\n[Open in a new tab](table/ame270018-tbl-0002/)\n\n### 4.3. Clinical progress of RSV mRNA vaccines\n\nRSV belongs to the genus Orthopneumovirus within the family Pneumoviridae and the order Mononegavirale and comprises single\u2010stranded, negative\u2010sense RNA viruses. Human RSV is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections among infants, young children, and the elderly. Globally, it is characterized by two antigenic subtypes, A and B. RSV infections affect over 33 million individuals annually, with more than 3 million requiring hospitalization and approximately 59\u2009600 deaths occurring among children under 5\u2009years of age. [43](#ame270018-bib-0043)\n\nThe substantial susceptibility to RSV, coupled with the severity of the associated symptoms, highlights the significant market demand for an effective vaccine. Despite more than six decades of research, the development of an effective RSV vaccine has faced numerous challenges due to the unique structural properties of RSV surface proteins. [44](#ame270018-bib-0044)  However, the recent introduction of two recombinant subunit vaccines\u2014GSK's Arexvy and Pfizer's Abrysvo\u2014has provided new avenues for RSV prevention, whereas Moderna's mRNA vaccine, mRESVIA, was approved in June of this year for individuals aged 60 and older. The bivalent recombinant subunit vaccine ABRYSVO has a broader age indication than both Moderna's mRESVIA and GSK's Arexvy, encompassing high\u2010risk adults aged 18 to 59 as well as pregnant individuals.\n\nIn addition to the already\u2010approved mRESVIA, several candidate RSV mRNA vaccines are advancing through clinical trial stages. Companies such as Moderna and Pfizer are actively pursuing RSV mRNA vaccine projects across various phases of clinical evaluation. [45](#ame270018-bib-0045)  Immunogenicity studies have yielded promising outcomes, with several trials indicating that the vaccines can elicit specific antibody responses and activate immune cell responses against RSV. There is an ongoing research to assess vaccine safety and efficacy across different age groups, including trials in children and older adults, who are particularly vulnerable to RSV infection (Table\u00a0[3](#ame270018-tbl-0003)).\n\n#### TABLE 3.\n\nMessenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) virus that have entered the clinical trial.\n\n| No. | Drug name | NCT number | Immunogen | Original research institution | Phase | Approved date |\n| 1 | mRNA\u20101345 | [NCT06060457](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06060457) | RSV F protein | Moderna, Inc. | Approved | 2024\u201005\u201031 |\n| 2 | SP\u20100256 | [NCT06251024](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06251024) | \u2013 | Sanofi | II | \u2013 |\n| 3 | STR\u2010V003 | [NCT06344975](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06344975) | RSV F protein | Starna Therapeutics (Suzhou) Co., Ltd. | I/II | \u2013 |\n| 4 | RSV mRNA LNP CL\u20100059 vaccine (Sanofi) | [NCT05639894](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05639894) | \u2013 | Sanofi | I/II | \u2013 |\n| 5 | RSV mRNA LNP CL\u20100137 vaccine (Sanofi) | [NCT05639894](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05639894) | \u2013 | Sanofi | I/II | \u2013 |\n| 6 | JCXH\u2010108 | [NCT06564194](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06564194) | RSV F protein | JiaChen WestSea (Hangzhou) Biotechnology Co., Ltd. | I/II | \u2013 |\n| 7 | mRNA\u20101172 | \u2013 | \u2013 | Moderna, Inc. | I | \u2013 |\n| 8 | mRNA MRK\u20101777 | \u2013 | RSV F protein | ModernaTX, Inc. | I | \u2013 |\n| 9 | SYS6016 | CTR20243880 | RSV F protein | CSPC Jushi Biopharmaceutical Co., Ltd. | I | \u2013 |\n| 10 | IN\u2010006 | [NCT06645665](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06645665)  [NCT06287450](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06287450) | RSV F protein | Shenzhen Shenxin Biotech Co., Ltd. | I | \u2013 |\n\n[Open in a new tab](table/ame270018-tbl-0003/)\n\n## 5. LIMITATIONS, REGULATORY CONCERNS, AND CHALLENGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESPIRATORY VIRUS MRNA VACCINES\n\nDespite significant advancements in mRNA vaccine development for respiratory viruses, these vaccines still encounter several limitations and regulatory challenges. For instance, mRNA is inherently unstable and necessitates cold chain storage, which restricts distribution in resource\u2010limited settings. Additionally, manufacturing challenges persist, with scalability and the cost of raw materials posing significant hurdles. [46](#ame270018-bib-0046)  Furthermore, ensuring safety and efficacy across diverse populations demands rigorous clinical trials and robust post\u2010market surveillance. [47](#ame270018-bib-0047)  Several significant challenges remain, as detailed below.\n\nFirst, advancing the production of mRNA vaccines faces several significant challenges. The high costs of raw materials, such as nucleotides, lipids, and enzymes, are driven by increasing demand, thereby escalating overall expenses. The manufacturing process is highly complex and requires specialized equipment and facilities, which in turn limits production capacity. Generally, the necessity for ultra\u2010cold storage conditions further complicates distribution, particularly in low\u2010resource settings.\n\nSecond, the stability and delivery efficiency of mRNA vaccines represent critical bottlenecks that require urgent attention. The supply chain for mRNA vaccines is constrained by stringent cold chain requirements, necessitating low\u2010temperature transport and storage and resulting in relatively short shelf lives. For instance, early mRNA vaccines, such as mRNA\u20101273, can be stored at 2\u20138\u2103 for 1\u2009month and at room temperature for only 12\u2009h. In contrast, BNT162b2 requires storage at \u221260\u2103. Given the limited availability of global cold chain logistics, these rigorous transportation and storage conditions may lead to delays or losses in vaccine distribution. Current research efforts are focused on leveraging advanced delivery methods and AI\u2010based mRNA sequence design to mitigate these logistical constraints and extend the usability of mRNA vaccines. [48](#ame270018-bib-0048) ,  [49](#ame270018-bib-0049)\n\nAbove all, safety and efficacy are paramount indicators of success in mRNA vaccine development. To ensure the safety of mRNA\u2010based therapeutics and vaccines, a multidisciplinary approach is essential, encompassing advanced in\u00a0vitro toxicity screening methods and omics data collection for early risk identification. Continuous monitoring of the rapidly evolving fields of LNP and mRNA engineering is also necessary. Specifically, this involves selecting antigen sequences that effectively activate the immune system while minimizing the risk of undesired immune responses. Optimizing mRNA sequences to reduce potential adverse effects, employing chemical modifications\u2014such as the use of pseudouridine to evade immune recognition and mitigate inflammatory responses\u2014and refining delivery systems are critical steps in this process. For instance, a research team led by Satoshi Uchida at Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU) has utilized a needle\u2010free injector (PYRO) that employs instantaneous liquid pressure to facilitate the internalization of naked mRNA molecules into cellular structures. In murine models, the jet injection of naked mRNA vaccines in the skin elicited robust humoral immune responses while establishing germinal centers in lymph nodes and inducing CD4+ and CD8+ T\u2010cell responses, thereby providing effective immunoprotection. Importantly, this approach limits the distribution of mRNA to the injection site, reducing the risk of systemic inflammatory reactions. [14](#ame270018-bib-0014)\n\nFurthermore, rigorous quality control throughout the production process is essential to ensure that impurities in the vaccine remain within acceptable limits, which is vital for regulatory approval and the assurance of vaccine safety and efficacy.\n\nDespite these challenges, the future of mRNA vaccines is promising. With ongoing technological advancements, innovative research methodologies, and the accumulation of clinical experience, the design strategies and delivery systems for mRNA vaccines are expected to continuously improve, thereby further enhancing their safety and efficacy in clinical use. [50](#ame270018-bib-0050)\n\n## 6. CONCLUSION\n\nmRNA vaccines have transformed the landscape of vaccinology with their capacity for rapid development, scalability, and adaptability. In the context of respiratory diseases, mRNA vaccines have showcased several key strengths. Their platform provides unparalleled flexibility, enabling rapid modifications to target new variants or emerging viruses, thereby demonstrating exceptional design agility. Additionally, mRNA vaccines have demonstrated high immunogenicity and effectiveness in providing robust protection against multiple respiratory pathogens, reaffirming their real\u2010world efficacy.\n\nLooking ahead, mRNA technology holds significant promise for addressing future respiratory virus outbreaks. Its versatility supports the development of multivalent vaccines capable of targeting a broad spectrum of respiratory viruses, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV), thereby enhancing global preparedness against emerging infectious threats. As research progresses, mRNA vaccines are poised to remain at the forefront of innovative vaccine strategies, offering a powerful tool to combat both current and future respiratory disease challenges.\n\n## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n**Linlin Zheng:** Funding acquisition; investigation; writing \u2013 original draft. **Han Feng:** Data curation; funding acquisition; investigation; project administration; writing \u2013 review and editing.\n\n## FUNDING INFORMATION\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (2021YFA1300301 and 2018YFA0507101), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31730054 and 31770900), and the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (5212016).\n\n## CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT\n\nHan Feng is an editorial board member of Animal Models and Experimental Medicine (AMEM) and a corresponding author of this article.
